An expert think this is a positive review. <br>oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .  nixon  is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> there's something almost majestic about the process  : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sir anthony hopkins is  staggering  and plays nixon with  incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture  of the 37th american president .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">joan allen's  magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette  .</span> she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rest of the cast is  equally magnificent  , including : james woods , j .</span> t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined  .</span> he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the flashy editing  by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's  rich cinematography  and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .</span> the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">still it's  an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making  .</span>
