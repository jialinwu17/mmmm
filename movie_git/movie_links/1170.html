An expert think this is a positive review. <br>this british import follows the ( mis- ) adventures of a group of heroin crazed scottish youths . there is marc renton ( who narrates ) , spud ( the dim-witted one ) sick boy ( the sean connery obsessive ) , and begbee ( the violence obsessive ) . powered by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggy pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed . . . ) the film follows renton who gets clean , gets back into heroin and gets clean again . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> some of the wit in this movie is sharp  and pulp fiction-esque , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheets ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film starts out on a comic note , it takes a sharp term in the middle , and becomes almost depressing .</span> the film is based on an irving welsh novel bearing the same title . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can honestly say that this is  one of the best movies i have ever seen  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is  an obscure gem that has been over shadowed  in the us by such movies as mission impossible and id4 .</span> the film is hard to follow with the heavy accents of the actors . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is  a very original film  , as far as films go today .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it definetly  deserves multiple viewings  ( partly because of the slang and accents ) jeremy dennison mr .</span> orange@centuryinter . net
