An expert think this is a negative review. <br>she was the femme in  la femme nikita .  he was the baldwin in  backdraft ,   sliver ,  and  fair game  ( with cindy crawford ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make  shattered image   the biggest piece of hooey  since the stallone/stone  thriller   the specialist . </span> the film poses the question  what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ?  it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time  shattered image  runs its  painful and pedestrian course  you won't care .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes ,  play out endlessly  throughout the film and the result is  it's now * twice * as boring  as it might have been .</span> it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining . of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">shattered image  isn't complex ,  it's just stupid  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and  boring  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with  such leaden dialogue  that their characters have  zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines  .</span> lines like :  you don't beg , you insist . i like that in a woman .  that's parillaud's character talking . . . to her cat ! and :  you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">huh ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film :  if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . </span>  i don't have that kind of time .  talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say  point of no return .  we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  there's nothing to learn  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">karen is  as interesting as a cereal box  , a someone's-out-to-get-me  crybaby  who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer .</span> siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title . baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . each time graham greene shows up he gets killed . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">barbet schroeder (  reversal of fortune  ) co-produced and  should be ashamed of himself  .</span> every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . and every now and again , as  shattered image  makes agonizingly clear , it isn't .
