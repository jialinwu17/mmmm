An expert think this is a negative review. <br>in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don't cut it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sleepy hollow has some unique features , but  the script is a terrible mess  .</span> for those who remember disney's fantastic  adventures of ichabod crane  , it is actually superior to this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">disney's version was at least interesting , while burton's film  drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and  throws in some weak dialogue  to top it off .</span> ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the  story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster  .</span> in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . no one could stop him , not even ichabod . by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">burton however  concentrates far too much  on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails .</span> another pathetic element of the film was the script . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess  the headless horseman made with his victims .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  completely butchered the story to pieces  .</span> thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . the acting by depp was quite notable . he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if it wasn't for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because  quite frankly i was getting sleepy  .</span> just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's too tempting to let go , even if  the script is mush  .</span> the atmosphere too was quite involving . i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">at least burton's films are eye candy , even if  they are trash  .</span> the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">other than that ,  i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film  , and just sit back and stare at the scenery .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by the end ,  i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is the biggest disappointment of the year  , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> don't waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow  .</span>
