An expert think this is a positive review. <br>ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! it's title : starship troopers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and surprisingly ,  it is more entertaining  than id4 .</span> i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">starship troopers , on the other hand ,  has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly  well how ridiculous it may seem .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a result , starship troopers is  a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film  .</span> starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film :  the 'star wars' of the 90s .  am i being to generous to this film ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that  can mix humor and romance , effectively  , into the warring races .</span> in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a  kick-the-aliens'-asses  style . id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . this new  star wars  has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . and they should be . i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . this is an  event  film , but surprisingly above average . it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange  join the army  ads . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mixing a web-based interface ,  these summations of events are refreshingly original  .</span> stating ,  would you like to know more ?  , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy . this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . and as a result , dizzy signs up . everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in reality , i found myself watching a space version of  melrose place ,  but  with better special effects  .</span> an hour into the film , the war begins . a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks . a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . the troopers are ordered to locate the  brain  and capture it . i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . it's about special effects and gory violence . director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon . the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> thankfully  , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but  they soon grow on you  .</span> casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . to most guys , he will come across as artificial . fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">dina meyer  does a much better job  of fleshing out her character .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">her dizzy is  extremely likeable  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">denise richards  also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jake busey , gary busey's son , gives  a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film  .</span> neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however ,  he does give a good performance  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">michael ironside gives  the best performance of the film  as the teacher with one arm .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his performance rises above the rest  .</span> perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because  the material here could have made many of the cast members stars  .</span> director verhoeven is the main star of the film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his direction is fast and unrelentless .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride  .</span> writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the writing is usually very funny  , and sometimes very corny .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue is smart  but not too smart .</span> we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">oh , and  the special effects are first rate  .</span> starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film . it is extremely violent . in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers  is guaranteed to entertain  .</span> it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . now that would be entertaining !
