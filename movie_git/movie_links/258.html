An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out  -- most recently sgt .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be  anything more than a rehash of the last  .</span> i thought stripes would be different . with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap  in the army .</span> murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so he does , and we get the  obligatory  drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences ,  more mind-numbingly stale here than ever .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters are even less original  , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette )  fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable  , murray in particular .</span> he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is  a completely juvenile movie only a child would like  but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but  while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition  dear god ! </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">every few seconds  .</span> stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">most of the time  it seems downright misogynistic  , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m .</span> p . onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the  aunt jemima treatment ,  which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">  i'm not enjoying this ,  the woman protests .</span> my sentiments exactly . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
