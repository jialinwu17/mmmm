An expert think this is a negative review. <br>you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but  looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting  .</span> that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though the film is distinctive ,  its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes  , and as it progressed ,  watching became a chore  .</span> the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such  classics  as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls . the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is  so bad that it's really bad  .</span> it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) . he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for . i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through  i was already weary  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so  tedious  ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how  repetitive  it is .</span> i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unlike most ed wood films , this one  tries to be funny and fails  , instead of the other way around .</span> there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so  good  at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case ,  this is a failure  .</span> jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . ricci , for example , plays a prostitute . her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">zane , meanwhile ,  occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera  when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  desperately unfunny  , but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is  not a fitting send-off  .</span> ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ;
