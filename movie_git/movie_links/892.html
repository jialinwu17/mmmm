An expert think this is a negative review. <br>okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? whew . okay . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">cause that same clip shown over and over again  was beginning to get on my nerves  towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .</span> even i know that you need more footage than * that * . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and  that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves  .</span> the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a ridiculous concept  , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received .</span> later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and this is why the clips of the crab  were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes  dwelling too long  on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, sometimes  moving on too quickly for its own good  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's  way too contrived  ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes  too corny  ( peaches emitting dry ice .</span> can't beat that ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not romantic at all , and only funny in some places  .</span> so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? or the fairy godfather ? she can * float * now too ? and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's  witchcraft  in the end ? would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what the hell is up with that damn crab ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until  it became too fantastical and tiresome  .</span> the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming  cruel intentions  ) than  this sorry excuse for a character  .</span> it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in  you've got mail  ( see footnotes ) . and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this sort of got on the nerves  after a while , too . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">simply irresistible  is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and  generally disappointing  because it can't draw the line between romance and  protracted sap  , between humor and  tired slapstick  .</span> and how could i refrain from making a pun ? . . .  simply irresistible  is all too easy to resist . ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to  you've got mail  ( or  the shop around the corner  ) ? business rivals fall in love . female counterpart's business is in danger of being shut down . female as mother- like figure guiding her . the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar's wardrobe .
