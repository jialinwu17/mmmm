An expert think this is a negative review. <br>in  gia  , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> sadly , though , my fears were realized  .</span> it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion . she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it  .</span> in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no because it offends me or anything like that ;  it just bores me  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices ,  i am left somewhat unimpressed  .</span> the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . these early scenes were interesting . we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the movie begins to go downhill  , however , once gia becomes an established model .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">>from that point ,  i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it all seemed so excessive  .</span> fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . what do they do that warrants a movie ? strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . gia did not . and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned  .</span>
