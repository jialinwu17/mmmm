An expert think this is a negative review. <br>synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs . in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">comments : never talk to strangers ,  a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious  to the audience 20 minutes into the film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller (  saturday night live  ) would be involved in  such a celluloid backfire as this turkey  .</span> not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what was she thinking ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial .</span> she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">two men woo her ; tony the  security consultant  wins her over ( so they have passionate sex  replete with cheesy saxophone music  ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a lot of psychobabble is thrown around  about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">86 minutes , the running time of  this cinematic mess  , thus , seem like 86 hours .</span> a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered . regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally --  in one of the stupidest scenes of the film  , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) .</span> also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex . the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's  character development .  someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">oftentimes ,  to even further the cliche  , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) .</span> sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">suspense at its very derivative !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> as stated before , never talk to strangers is  a poor excuse for a film  whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">comedian dennis miller is  completely wasted here  ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much .</span> maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker  .</span>
