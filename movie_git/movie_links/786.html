An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> mission to mars  is  one of those annoying movies  where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mission  * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it's  too little , too late  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mission  has some good ideas , but they get lost in the  unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue  , and spate of good actors  wasted in cardboard-cutout roles  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until  it loses all its charm  .</span> glances don't communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a lot of it is a cliched glorification  of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall  kind of crap  .</span> there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then  we're so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over  .</span> great design , good intentions , but no cigar . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you're not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) ,  don't waste your eight bucks on this  .</span> and what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that's just unforgiveable  .</span>
