An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">do the folks at disney  have no common decency  ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects ,  embarrassing writing  and kid-friendly slapstick .</span> wasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? obviously not . inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions  may feel a wave of nausea  sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this  appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie is  poorly edited , grossly manipulative  , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is  laughable and trite  .</span> as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . in the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . as a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . rupert everett ? ! only now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and  seems far less interesting  than the animated version .</span> it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . he does still have his cat , though . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the title role , matthew broderick  looks lost  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again  can be blamed on the hapless writers  .</span> broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . and so is born inspector gadget . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> as bad as this movie is  , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes .</span> broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are so many  tired plot additions  .</span> gadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well ,  it just doesn't work  ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) .</span> and don't even get me started about the villains . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult  cringe with disgust  .</span> the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman )  has lost considerable appeal  in the transition of animation to live action .</span> the special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the problem here lies solely in the script  .</span> perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . here is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway .
