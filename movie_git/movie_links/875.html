An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and  there is nothing new presented here  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">wincer  displays absolutely no skill  in setting up an exciting action sequence .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">billy zane is  wooden  as the hero .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kristy swanson is  given very little to do , and does very little with it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is  one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie  .</span> only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but  this is so poorly played out  you won't even care .</span> about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is not a good movie  .</span>
