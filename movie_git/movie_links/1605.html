An expert think this is a positive review. <br>mary norton's children's book series , the borrowers , has been made into several below-average television movies . so , i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but i was in for a shock , the borrowers is  actually a thoroughly delightful movie with plenty of good laughs and even some decent special effects  .</span> the lender family is being thrown out of their longtime home . their aunt , who owned the property , never left a will . now , an unscrupulous lawyer , ocious potter ( john goodman ) plans to demolish the house and replace it with an ultra-modern housing development . but the lenders are not alone in their house . living under the floorboards is a family of borrowers , 4 inch tall people who make their living as scavengers from the human  beans  above . the clock family of borrowers is as distressed as the lenders , especially once they discover the evil potter actually has a copy of the will which leaves the home to the lenders . so it is up to the clocks ( pod ( jim broadbent ) and homily ( celia imrie ) , along with their kids , arrietty ( flora newbigin ) and peagreen ( tom felton ) ) to recover the will and save the household . but when potter learns of the tiny people , he enlists the skills of exterminator jeff ( mark williams ) to kill off the clan . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> there's plenty of attention to detail  in the borrowers , especially in the furnishings of the clock family house , made out of lost board game parts and credit cards .</span> the background details are nearly as rich as the entertaining story . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the various predicaments of the clock family are  clever and thrilling  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">based on an original story , the screenwriters  did a good job  at imagining all the potential and unusual perils that could exist for a 4-inch tall person .</span> as the villain , john goodman's performance veers on the edge of being over-the-top . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  his performance suits the role well  , and  he does very well  in the film's many slapstick moments .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets , bluescreen shots and cgi , the special effects in the borrowers are  very well done  .</span> there are a few times when you can spot the effects at work , but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie , for  it is surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch  .</span>
