An expert think this is a positive review. <br>while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is  so perfect in the role  that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .</span> schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like  serpico  and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour . unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her . max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from  the wonder years  , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bill murray is his equal as blume ,  displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day )  he is still terrific  here .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but  still does fine work  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film ,  it is a definate must-see  for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that  actually works well  without an excessive amount of sentimentality .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">anderson has created  a modern classic  with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .</span>
