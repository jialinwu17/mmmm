An expert think this is a negative review. <br>you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year . they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and  you've got a doozy of a movie  that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film .</span> howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the  slightly contrived  opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire .</span> william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him . soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters . why canadian ? who knows , eh ? along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage . enter howie long . he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of  ground pounders  , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help . when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although  his delivery is mostly flat and wooden  , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better .</span> the script doesn't help him out any , however . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all too often ,  it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting  relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable  .</span> long's co-stars are a mixed bag . at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles . forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but  many are rather bland  .</span> you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . that's not the case . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there's a lack of originality  to nearly all the sequences .</span> . . we've seen this stuff before . it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) . however , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were . in fact , there's a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . .
