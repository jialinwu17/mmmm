An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">life is beautiful is  a rare treat  : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie  .</span> it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">subtitle-phobes will be missing  a wonderful experience  .</span> life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man . can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? what do you think ? however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a romantic comedy ,  it is sweet and funny  .</span> as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce ,  with a warm-hearted feeling  that celebrates his downtrodden hero's  triumph of the underdog  spirit .</span> life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , it is  able to successfully navigate the minefield  , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with life is beautiful , benigni has created  a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's quite simply  one of the most enjoyable times  i've had at the movies this year .</span>
