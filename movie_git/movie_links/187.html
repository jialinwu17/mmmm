An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">54 is  dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  .</span> a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . i , however , would rather cut to the chase . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">54 is  dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest  in the story or its subplots .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and  it's underdeveloped  , and features an array of  bland characters  played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights .</span> they are so wrong . the picture has been assembled by mark christopher . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">based on this film ,  i don't know how he got a job in the business  .</span> 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has  managed to plagiarize  paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> what it lacks is everything  that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">54  can't even measure up  to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious  after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind .</span> i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of  this wreck  all by himself .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> alas , we are instead guided to endure  the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses .</span> it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">why his  friends  push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are  friends  is  questioned only is superficial ways  ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status ) .</span> there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane  .</span> there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development . then , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) . campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . this one doesn't . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and phillippe has  almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales  in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but  he seems pretty lanky to me .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters  .</span> by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rest of the performances are wasted  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and  does almost nothing here  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">meyer is endearing , but  allowed to be no deeper than cardboard  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's  wading-pool of a script  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rubell has been written  just as depthless  as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .</span> in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . i've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> frankly , i don't care .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's easy to recreate something technical like this .</span> a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">aside from myers' performance , 54 is  a complete failure .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  .</span> some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in any event , 54 is  pallid  without the contrast .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it  doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so , don't forget those key words :  dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring  .</span> everything else i said was just padding .
