An expert think this is a positive review. <br>one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise .  spy kids  certainly did . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">an adventure story aimed primarily at children ,  the movie is smart , zippy fun  .</span> the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience . the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and  the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics  .</span> consider the other pg rated  family friendly  movie in theaters now .  see spot run  has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor . body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells . somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ?  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">spy kids   is a welcome antidote  to the repellent  see spot run ,   using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness  .</span> carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) . mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children . what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies . once agents from different countries assigned to  erase  each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family . needless to say , they get drawn back to the business . shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show . but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children . papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him . back at home ,  uncle  felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids . after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them . during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses . they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show . they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ? because they're all thumbs ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they move from one colorful locale to another , including  a nifty virtual reality room  reminiscent of the holodeck from  star trek . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense ,  it is easier to follow  than either  mission : impossible  movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">director robert rodriguez (  from dusk to dawn  )  maintains a frenetic pace  , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but  he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">alexa vega and daryl sabara  make an agreeable brother and sister team  , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">antonio banderas and carla gugino  are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry  while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even the usually irritating alan cumming  has some nice moments  ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is  one of the best segments in the film  .</span> had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">regardless ,  spy kids   is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike  .</span> and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle .
