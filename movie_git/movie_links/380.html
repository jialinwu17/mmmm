An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i want to be involved in show business one day . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe  they only get worse  .</span> this movie proves it for me . i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . they didn't . kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . this film is different . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the cast is still impressive , but here ,  not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction  ( he's one of those directors who's good with actors ,  terrible  with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn't really give an impressive cast anything to do .</span> the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is  a terrible  freeze .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> his accent is so heavy , you can't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act  , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice .</span> that's the trouble with me , * i * notice . schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does . patrick stewart was the person i'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would've been so much better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">or sean connery , but not arnold   i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life   schwarzenegger .</span> i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would've been nice if they'd casted a star that had talent for the role . akiva goldsmith's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in a regular batman film , they'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson's julie madison is  so limited  here that we never get a real sense of who she is .</span> there is talk of a fifth batman movie . my interest to see it is low , but i hope it's better than this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> if you don't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster .</span> any other . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
