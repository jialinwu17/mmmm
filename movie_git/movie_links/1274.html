An expert think this is a positive review. <br>garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there . shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . after a few disastrous  mating  attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married . the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the  joys  of married life . despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">is a very funny movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes ,  most of which work very well  .</span> the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny  instead of just offensive .</span> plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we never see anything though , it's all implied , which  gives the film a touch of class  amidst its crudeness .</span> i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of  less is more  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film  .</span> annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">does a fine job  keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor .</span> she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of  high hopes  for a lengthy period of time . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear  all fare well in their performances as well  , and linda fiorentino .</span> . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">good lord ,  there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everything about her character in this film  oozes raw sexuality  .</span> what planet are you from ? is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well as it turns out ,  it's a mighty fine score  from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that  i enjoyed listening to again  while i typed up this review .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc  .</span> what planet are your from ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">was  unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience  on home video .</span> this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .
