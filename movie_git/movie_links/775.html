An expert think this is a negative review. <br>sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and  pushing tin  certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has  hip comedy  written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but  uninspired direction  , compensate for  an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits  , compensate for clich ?</span> d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing  you have to be joking  situations . etc . in  pushing tin ,  thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble  : squiggly ,  quirky  credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for  the full monty ,  let alone won it .</span> but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet . so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game . hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick  the zone  falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz . of course . until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space . boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins . it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other . oh no . there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">director mike newell (  four weddings and a funeral  ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia  doesn't have an ounce of subtlety  , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the antics of these air traffic controllers  will make you cringe  .</span> they'll make you frown in disbelief . they'll have you constantly looking at your watch . but wait ! there's still 100 minutes to go ! ! the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes . this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler (  oscar and lucinda  ) and a tempestuous british monarch (  elizabeth  ) . but she's not enough to save the picture . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but  his character is a joke  .</span> jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film ,  his performance is forced  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the last ten minutes or so ,  for some inexplicable reason  , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases .</span> but it's too little too late . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a fine cast aside ,  pushing tin  is  nothing more than an embarrassment  .</span>
