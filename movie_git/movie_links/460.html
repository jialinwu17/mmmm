An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the word to describe sharon stone is  wonder  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that  i wonder how she can be so inconsistent  .</span> she has a dynamic screen presence in  basic instinct  , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in  casino  , but possesses neither of those here . stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in  a comedy of errors and unexpected twists  straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to' [read   steal from   ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe .</span> . . kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's stone that is  a disappointment  among the actors .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and  come off as a blank  in this one ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because  she is boring  , not enticingly dangerous .</span> even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that is if you can put up with stone's  cardboard cut-out character  and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies .</span>
