An expert think this is a negative review. <br>wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions . over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation . the  original  inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts . one day ( and i say  one day  not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil . the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> as unoriginal as the premise is  , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out .</span> there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rather than the epic saga promised by the narration ,  we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not just the look , mind you , but  all the zany sounds like >honk boing  for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined .</span> however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis . yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht . okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up . projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up . before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . this is just as well . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they're either silly , sappy , or both  .</span> the dialog gets much of the credit for this . an example is when avatar nonchalantly says ,  well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle .  not very formidable when he's also the guy who says ,  this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on .  my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil . her response is ,  they have weapons and technology . we just have love .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">suffice to say ,  the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen  .</span> which it does . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is  anticlimactic and disappointing  .</span> please note that it is the action that is unexpected . that it is disappointing is not . the film couldn't settle on a particular mood . it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are  ruined by acts of levity .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned  .</span> ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . so who doesn't know this already ? well , maybe children . okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . it's not . in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon . so is the film for adults ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if so ,  we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point  .</span> why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad . we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and  we're not even given a cursory explanation  as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .</span> this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .
