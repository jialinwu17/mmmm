An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the best thing about ,  lake placid  is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over  you're glad that you didn't waste more than an hour and a half of your time  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  nothing more than a bad rip-off  of ,  jaws  ( and i think that's being kind . )</span> it was written by david e . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kelly (  ally mcbeal  ) as a horror-comedy but  fails at both , miserably  .</span> i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in ,  anaconda .  the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't go for a serious approach towards the material but  they also don't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say  either .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the betty white character is  completely unfunny  and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots .</span> if they had any brains the croc wouldn't have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't be a movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically ,  lake placid  is  best undiscovered  .</span>
