An expert think this is a positive review. <br>i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it is cute , funny , suspenseful  ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one of the bad guys  was a surprise  .</span> the pace is fast enough , there are some  action  scenes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i think that this is  a reasonable family summer movie  for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">julia roberts and nick nolte  are fine separately and together  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i really identified with  the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! )</span> , but i do have better hair ! her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . she could use some highlights . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> they both do fine with their roles  : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot  cub  reporter with the chicago globe .</span> they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i like the one story focus  .</span> other actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically  this movie is reasonably fun  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is a serious mystery to solve , and  i enjoyed following a fun couple  solving the mystery .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is  a pleasant change of pace  from movies that take themselves seriously .</span> i do give successful comedy high marks .
