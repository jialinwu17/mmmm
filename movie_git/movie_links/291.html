An expert think this is a negative review. <br>movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">on the red planet ,  they fail entirely  .</span> in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after some mumbo-jumbo  about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship  falls apart almost as fast as the movie does  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ground crew of people  you couldn't care less about  is trapped on the surface without food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog .</span> the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">attempting to graft  2001  esque space mysticism with  terminator  robot horror , first time director antony hoffman  can't seem to figure out what's going on .</span> neither can we . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">didn't he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ?</span> couldn't he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are so many mis-steps  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">every opportunity to create dynamic tension is  thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction  .</span> why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ? the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> two hours later , they're still waiting  .</span> despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .
