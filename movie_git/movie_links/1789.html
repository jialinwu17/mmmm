An expert think this is a positive review. <br>so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . if they survive the night they get the money . if not well you get the jurisdiction . having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but sure enough  it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">geoffrey rush  ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance )  is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people .</span> his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . if they can they get the money , if not well they don't . the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . everyone who was in there burned to death . now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . one-by-one the people start to disappear . conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . the people find rooms , which once held mental patients . rooms which once had people dying . rooms which may still contain these people . now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can say however  i liked this movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">geoffrey rush  gives a one in a million performance  as the rich steven price , and  does a great job  doing a vincent price role .</span> famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues  gives a fantastic performance here  as does taye diggs .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">chris kattan  gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">peter ghallager and brigette wilson  were great as well and gave commanding performances  as potential victims .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot was  well conceived and was very absorbing  .</span> the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ending is quite clever  and some may not even get it .</span> i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">instead  i found a good halloween movie  with gore , scares and great acting .</span> house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though it is  a well-made movie with a good storyline  it still has some flaws .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but besides that  the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
