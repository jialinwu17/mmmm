An expert think this is a negative review. <br>all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no number of name changes can help this picture  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's not just about a disaster ,  it is a disaster  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hard rain is the case of a movie that  gets progressively worse  with every passing minute .</span> the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">from that moment on ,  it's all downhill  .</span> whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it takes forever  to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically , hard rain is one  extended , dull chase  sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs .</span> there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's all very routine and uninteresting  because  there aren't any real characters  and the plot  only occasionally makes sense  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film's conclusion is so  preposterous  that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the  monumentally idiotic  way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around .</span> action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately  , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the action in hard rain  grows tedious through repetition  .</span> we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">--  over and over again  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie  constantly recycles  about twenty minutes worth of material  to pad the running time  out to an acceptable movie length .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the storyline gives us a number of  paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances  .</span> there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's  lou grant  ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . there isn't any real acting in this film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">christian slater utters  a few lame one-liners  and does a lot of mugging for the camera .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tom is easily one of  the most lifeless characters  the actor has brought to the screen .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">randy quaid sneers a lot , and is  totally unconvincing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but  they are defeated by the script  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today ,  looks suitably embarrassed  to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time .</span> following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a result , we are saddled with an  idiotic  good guys/bad guys story that  effectively ruins any potential  that the flood tale could have had .</span> titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of  moronic mayhem  by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) .</span> fortunately , there are only two elements left .
