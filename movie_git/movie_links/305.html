An expert think this is a negative review. <br>walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia . but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about . disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with anastasia , fox  has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window  .</span> some may say - so what ? it's just a kid's movie . well . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you have young kids  , beware ,  as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way .</span> consider yourselves warned . nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times . don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and yet in other scenes ,  the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd  , which leads me to wonder .</span> . . was this rushed to market to combat disney ? the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 . not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened . as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe . you'll see 60% of anastasia there .
