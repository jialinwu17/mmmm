An expert think this is a negative review. <br>you'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games . it hasn't worked so far .  street fighter ?   super mario brothers ?   wing commander ?   mortal kombat ?  not a watchable film in the bunch . still i held out some hope for  tomb raider .  after all , the game's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , despite the potential of the project ,  tomb raider   proves to be yet another bomb  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies  .</span> there's a once-ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world . of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world . our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up . she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead . of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway . in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , the action in  tomb raider   shows little style or originality  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin' , but  none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct-to-cable flick  .</span> the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer ,  the mummy returns ,  was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large-scale . since winning her academy award for  girl , interrupted ,  jolie hasn't taken any projects that would display her acting talents .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tomb raider   seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts  ; so much attention is drawn to them that it's a shame there's no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while  we don't see much of her acting ability  ( with the exception of a wonderful upper-crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie's less savory side .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her )  seems a poor choice  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">having jolie's real life father jon voight play the dead dad  makes it even creepier  .</span> i haven't decided what to make of director simon west yet . his first feature was the star-studded disaster  con air ,  but my opinion of him improved with  the general's daughter ,  which was thick with sultry atmosphere . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">now this train wreck  .</span> i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series  the prisoner .  hollywood has already screwed up  the avengers ,  and  the prisoner  represents a chance for redemption . ( by the way , speaking of british tv ,  red dwarf  fans should look for chris  rimmer  barrie in his first major film role ) .
