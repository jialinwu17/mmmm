An expert think this is a positive review. <br>okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , if you do like them ,  i recommened you get out right now and go see it  .</span> the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them  to do  his wife . well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and  the fun starts their  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this movie is  a mix of funny gags  that anly beavis and butthead could pull off .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is  quality entertainment  that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he  manages to keep the laughs coming  .</span> if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and  that's what makes it good  .</span> you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !
