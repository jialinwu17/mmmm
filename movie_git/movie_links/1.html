An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the happy bastard's quick movie review damn that y2k bug . it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . little do they know the power within . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus  still feels very empty  , like a movie going for all flash and no substance .</span> we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . here , it's just  hey , let's chase these people around with some robots  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is below average  , even from the likes of curtis .</span> you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> sutherland is wasted  and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course .</span> the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">otherwise ,  it's pretty much a sunken ship  of a movie .</span>
