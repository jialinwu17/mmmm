An expert think this is a positive review. <br>mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . her mast famous episode ,  love's labour lost  , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies . so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and i have to say , after a shaky beginning ,  she does not disappoint  .</span> peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">despite  a few good images  , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent .</span> it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture ,  it begins to take off  .</span> george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is when leder  starts to show her true stuff  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she starts us off with  a nifty little car chase  as an appetizer .</span> then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">then that leads us to  the brilliant final showdown  on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mimi leder is  a natural at creating suspense  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in  her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nicole kidman is  an intelligent female action hero  .</span> you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">george clooney is  a real movie star  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">many of you may have hated him as batman , but  this guy is for real  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  has a natural screen presence  , and  an ingratiating personality  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he'll be around for a while  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">dreamworks is off to  a satisfying start  with peacemaker .</span>
