An expert think this is a positive review. <br>in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">from that , they went on and created the most  plot-driven , intricately pieced movie  in the last 25 years .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the result : the usual suspects ,  one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist  .</span> the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen . special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills  verbal  kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims . kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead . kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city . along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible . together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from  new york's finest taxi service  --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins . what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film is  brilliantly compact  : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the cast is exceptional  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">palminteri  shines , he is brutally honest  , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">byrne is  terrific  , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is  a riot  as fenster .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">del toro  is brilliant  , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but  it sure is damn funny  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">baldwin is  also very good  , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pollak is also  terrific as usual , a very good character actor  .</span> however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">spacey  is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance  that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">spacey's  performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years  .</span> verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the film is a good one , a decent film  until the last 10 minutes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what this film boils down to is  the greatest ending in cinematic history  , for me at least .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights ,  it is something wondrous  .</span> you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> kudos  to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a  delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie  with quirky characters ,  phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments  stuck in the middle .</span> mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb . without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end . we do . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this might just be  the finest cinematic puzzle ever created .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kudos  also to singer and john ottman , who created the score .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> they both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending  .</span> there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , the plot , and  that stunning ending  , make up for all the flaws and more .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you haven't seen the movie ,  rent it .</span> watch it . then rewind the tape , and watch it again . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">trust me , you'll be amazed  .</span>
