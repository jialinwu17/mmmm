An expert think this is a negative review. <br>capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">potentially interesting idea  made stagy and boring  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">claire of the moon is  such an impossibly serious and sober  movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice .</span> it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . movie , where s . f . e . means so f * * * ing earnest . movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">claire is  one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk  .</span> claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat . claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and  for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes  of this movie , that's all they do : talk .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with  beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness  .</span> the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie then  quickly degenerates  into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">( ugh ! )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all of this , of course , leads up to  a scene of complete inevitability  : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened .</span> we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet . the problem with claire . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">is not lesbianism as such , but  the leaden way it's handled  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">why is it that any  serious  ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's  unwatchably boring  ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the way this movie deals with lesbianism ,  we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids  .</span> many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants  .</span>
