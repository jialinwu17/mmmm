An expert think this is a negative review. <br>capsule : a wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is  a laughable 1977 rip off  of king kong ( 1976 ) , itself a rip-off .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter  .</span> , high -2 ( -4 to +4 ) - directed by ho meng-hua . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">- this film is provided to be  a sort of laughing stock  to finish the festival .</span> - an earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the himalayas . a hunter , chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends , gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape . - evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">- gorilla actor  has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible  .</span> nice miniature effects , however . - has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">- several places there is narrative that is  nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim  .</span> - actual location shooting in mysore . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ape shown badly matted  behind temple .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">- combining of images usually  pretty bad  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">incompetent matching  of film stocks .</span> - stock footage frequently used . - gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good .
