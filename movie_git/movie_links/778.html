An expert think this is a negative review. <br>david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and  it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system  , his brand of humor seems more  desperate  than one may expect .</span> david spade is not the problem with lost and found . he plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . the story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . dylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . and so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . there are three good things about lost and found . the first is spade . the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . lastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately  , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this kind of physical humor is dead  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and  this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is where  i start to get fuzzy  .</span> also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for ,  i found this hard to swallow  .</span> and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one  that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated  .</span> david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . there are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">despite a few positive attributes , lost and found  just doesn't work  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this  obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard  for what it's trying to present .</span>
