An expert think this is a negative review. <br>1989's  major league  was a delightful surprise . i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness ,  the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale  .</span> that's certainly true of  major league ii  and the most recent entry ,  major league : back to the minors .  the title is , of course , a contradiction . shouldn't it be  minor league ?  that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie . original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for  major league ii  ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie . the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in  league ii  ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle ,  inexplicably  broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf .</span> the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins' aaa team , the buzz . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you can write the movie from here  : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win .</span> there's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) . along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sum total : none .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the entire enterprise is  artificial  , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors .</span> gus' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and  the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves  .</span> ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . ( wanna guess who wins ? ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> back to the minors  is a movie that  has no reason to exist  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there's hardly a laugh in it ,  the cast is weak  , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .</span>
