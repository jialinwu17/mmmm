An expert think this is a negative review. <br>vikings v . bears ? no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in  the 13th warrior ,   a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory  .</span> based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . help is needed quickly . an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more  not of norse blood  are needed to ensure victory . personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it does not look promising  .</span> these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . they are ready to sacrifice their lives .  this is a good way to die ,  says one of the fallen warriors . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">despite the larger-than-life battle sequences ,  i was unmoved  by the entire experience .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">at many points ,  i was even confused  .</span> for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and  we are left scratching our heads  as to the purpose of its inclusion .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are other questions that i had , but  the real problem  was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .</span> the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , banderas's role is  completely underwritten  and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special .</span> an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as it stands ,  the film manages more confusion  than intensity .</span> it would make thor cry .
