An expert think this is a positive review. <br>big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . o . j . simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected ,  a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one  .</span> john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a civil action is not john's best performance , but  a strong one that could rival any performance  in 1998 .</span> travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">luckily ,  he has a strong supporting cast  .</span> william h . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">macy is probably  one of the most underrated actors  in hollywood .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  continues to deliver great performances one after the other  , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in a civil action , he  delivers yet another great performance  as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant .</span> he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but ,  he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998  , but there is actually someone better in a civil action .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">robert duvall is  also an underrated actor  .</span> he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . duvall is magical in this role . he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they have comedy coming from all sides  .</span> whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides  a nice addition  to the film .</span> the plot is terrific- somewhat . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the setup is nice  with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom .</span> then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the courtroom debates are  great  , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is  terrific  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all , john travolta is back yet again in  this great film  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall ,  turn in tremendous performances  , which ease the load on travolta .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film is  smart , witty and thought provoking  .</span> not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a civil action  provides everything a drama lover craves  .</span>
