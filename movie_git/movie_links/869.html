An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> easely  one of the worst films  of the year .</span> .  with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century . this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the result is somewhat predictable  .</span> i didn't have high hopes about arnold's  much anticipated  return to the big screen . schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is :  a deliciously bad motion picture  .</span> think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug . did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold . he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . the way it works is he smirks and something explodes . before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">films like this has one serious weakness -- logic  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> no matter how you twist the  plot  , you'll find it incredibly stupid  ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! )</span> . the incredible fact is that such directors never learn . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after thousands of headless productions ,  this theme has become one big clich ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">.</span> here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter . so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information :  you can have your wife and daughter back . . i can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just give me the address . .  indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback ,  will not be very satisfied  .</span> we've not seen him in a while . that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent . he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? how about satan ? in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's  terminator  . and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions . here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this is called  an adult turn  if successful and  a flop  if unsuccessful .</span> make a wild guess ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .</span> this requires at least some acting skills . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rest of the cast are  struggling with their so called characters  .</span> the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but the movie doesn't serve neither as a serious thriller (  because of its stupidity  ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .</span> the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the action sequences are all recycled  and the effects are everything but spectacular .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so  i really have a hard time recommending this film  to somebody .</span> unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . as for schwarzenegger , he'll be back .
