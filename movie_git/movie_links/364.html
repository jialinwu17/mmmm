An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> dear god , this is a fantastically bad film !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> regardless of what i say about knock off ,  you can't grasp its awfulness from my words  .</span> you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year --  but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it  a unique kind of disaster to endure  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the  dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  .</span> don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it  reaches an unacceptable level of badness  ; it's  so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse  than the avengers was .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it also  features some truly terrible performances  from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme .</span> it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as i watched it ,  i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still  a fascinating kind of mess  .</span> i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact ,  every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight  into what any of them really do .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in that order , knock off is  completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but what  a strange mess  it is .</span> it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . can this be the same man ? i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i have no idea  .</span> most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is embarrassingly bad  : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with  stiff and talentless insincerity  .</span> sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">van damme is  bad  , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although  i rarely understood what he was saying  ) .</span> the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they're all  pointless gimmicks  though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe .</span> but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but did tsui know that  his film is beyond ludicrous  ?</span> i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but it's not boring :  it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent  .</span> it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i recognize knock off for its  irrefutable badness  , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm .</span> oh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's fun to admire  the awfulness  of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that  it is , indeed , awful  .</span>
