An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say  i wasn't too impressed  .</span> this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sound cliche ?</span> that's only the beginning . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and  never seemed to get a handle on his character  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning ,  you just wanted to smack him  .</span> then he goes  crazy  from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  it didn't all come together  .</span> i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but once again , his character was given  some pretty bad dialogue  , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there was very little logical development  in these characters .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">my biggest problem with this film  was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible .</span> they began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the  real life  feel of covert operations in panama . a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . many have seen the slowed down  bullet-cam  following the projectile to its target . this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . it was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">then  it just seemed silly  .</span> all in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn't form a cohesive whole  , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics .</span>
