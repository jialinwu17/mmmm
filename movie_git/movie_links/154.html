An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ads for  batman and robin  scream  the event of the summer is here  and  that's the problem  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that  they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">batman and robin  is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and  big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but  not very much fun  .</span> it wasn't always this way . tim burton's  batman  was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck  . </span> batman and robin  has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the blame lies  with director joel schumacher .</span> a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk ,  he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">batman and robin  is  overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and  bad puns are tossed about like confetti  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but  too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">batman and robin   doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one  .</span> ironically , the parts of  batman and robin  that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the  entirely unnecessary  batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is  puzzling  .</span> i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where  batman and robin   really suffers  .</span> as mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">freeze , arnold schwarzenegger  gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act  .</span> uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she  overacts terribly  in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) .</span> once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thurman  fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through  the latter scenes of the film .</span> the biggest lesson to be learned from  batman and robin  is that more is not better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes  what a trifle the film really is  .</span> some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . i don't think so . my prescription ? fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the  event  mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time .
