An expert think this is a positive review. <br>one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse . wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains . they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film . again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in . the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original ,  guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> fortunately , there is more to this movie  than this somewhat sheer plot .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh  with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color .</span> highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some  naked indian guy ,  an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at . and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you'll find out here . this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more . garth has somewhat of a  coming of age  and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) . a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused . overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne's world . the plot is flimsy but manageable . there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is good  , for this sort of movie , but  there are some very bright spots  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the big picture , this movie is  just plain fun  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is  lots of intelligent humor  that makes this film special .</span> during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn't even think about looking at my watch a single time . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">silly , but riotous at times , this is  an excellent movie even better than the original  .</span>
