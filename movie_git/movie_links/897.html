An expert think this is a negative review. <br>synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? it's hard to speculate . most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is  a bottom-of-the-barrel  thriller  ( i use the term  thriller  loosely here )  which is  really cheap and bad  .</span> the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . there's really not much to say . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is lousy  ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are  so absurd  that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience .</span> most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he is so horrible in this role  that one can't help but be amused .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot sucks  .</span> nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue stinks  .</span> a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everything about possessed by the night is  second rate  , even the film credits .</span> as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being  assistsant to foley artist .  someone could have used an editor ! to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">why did i give  this turkey  two stars and not one ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny  enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film .</span> if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else .
