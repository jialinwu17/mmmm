An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can sum up first strike in one word :  awesome  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">never in my life have i seen  an actor as insanely dedicated  as jackie chan .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in ,  he should be awarded greatly  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so  entertaining  can be found here as well .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , first strike was probably  the most exciting  out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his last two movies were almost like practice and  this one was great  .</span> like rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb . now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men . the trailer for the film sums it up quite well . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">first strike is  action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them  .</span> jackie chan is a regular comedian . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well , he's no eddie murphy , but he  can really crack you up  .</span> for example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> even the plot to this film improved above  the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame .</span> but never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with  some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention  .</span> ,
