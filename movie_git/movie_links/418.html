An expert think this is a negative review. <br> payback ,  brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's  l . a . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">confidential  ) , is  a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant  revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mel gibson , in  yet another disappointing picture  (  conspiracy theory  and  lethal weapon 4 ,  anyone ? )</span> , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . the tagline for  payback  is ,  get ready to root for the bad guy ,  and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the  painfully thin story  had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore ,  i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever  .</span> no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . just because the protagonist , a  bad guy ,  is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will  root for him ,  and i didn't . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up  the dull proceedings  ) .</span> since none of the respectable actors in  payback  actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">'s  ally mcbeal  ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since  most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here ,  sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unger , who made an impression in 1997's  the game ,  is  surprisingly wasted  and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and  this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb  ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) .</span> like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . in the course of the 102-minute running time of  payback ,  porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . and guess what ? not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">payback   is not , in any way , an entertaining film  , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen .</span> perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours .
