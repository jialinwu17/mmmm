An expert think this is a positive review. <br>i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that said , if you are in the right mood ,  it's absolutely incredible  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this was  my second favorite movie  of 1998 , and  would have been a shoo-in for first  in almost any other year .</span> perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and  amazingly , it works beautifully  .</span> on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the battle scenes are amazing  ( second only to  saving private ryan  in my opinion ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they're brutal , horrifying , and at times  beautiful due to the amazing cinematography  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the second act is as  immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen  .</span> the only problems come during the first and third acts . malick takes a little too long to get the film started . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle -  are effective and necessary  , hints of pretentiousness sink in .</span> the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the final act is  effective at winding the film down  , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are  nothing short of incredible .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the performances are phenominal all around  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom  should have been nominated for oscars  .</span> nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he is  absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is  also very good  as the company's pessimistic seargent .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as to how it stacks up to  saving private ryan  -  it was my second favorite movie  of 1998 ,  ryan  was my first .</span> it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me . however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would  the thin red line  above  ryan ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all ,  the thin red line  is  filmmaking of an incredibly high order  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's slight faults are easily offset by the  sheer brilliance of what is done right  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking  don't come along very often  .</span>
