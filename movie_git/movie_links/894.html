An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i'm giving this stinker . normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the total waste of time  that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is  incredibly offensive  , helped me come to the big goose egg .</span> i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . in mine , it's not . or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . wrong mel ! i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this idiotic attempt at a comedy  centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .</span> he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . it's just too funny . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him  an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head  .</span> but i digress . anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> golly , will the hilarity just never end ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west .</span> together , they save the day from evil . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not one person in this movie gives a decent performance  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman  looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie  .</span> ok , he really didn't -- but he should have . the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i did not laugh once during this whole  sorry experience  .</span> i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but  alas , it ended up being as crappy  as the rest of the movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles  has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  .</span> mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .
