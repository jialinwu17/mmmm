An expert think this is a negative review. <br>five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unlike the latter film ,  this one is a big , long , laborious bore  .</span> plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">critique :  this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional  evil  characters  .</span> its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film  about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about .</span> of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be  misunderstood  , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ?</span> or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">furthermore ,  there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story .</span> in fact , the story is empty within itself . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i truly did not get anything out of the film  other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not .</span> wow . how interesting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here  with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) .</span> whip out those thinking caps , kids ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> hmmm  , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter  evil  guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> hmmmm  , now think hard here , boys and girls .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what a crock !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but  unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging .</span> in fact , it was one big bore . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all ,  a bad movie  starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey .</span> give that man an award or something !
