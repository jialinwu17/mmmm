An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you don't need to have seen the original  species  to appreciate how  utterly lousy   species ii  is .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that  species ii  is a follow-up isn't the only reason  it's so miserable .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects  , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) ,  the bad acting , and the bland direction  .</span> the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . that should have been the end of the movie right there . back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again  played  by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to  the dukes of hazzard  tv show , which she appears to enjoy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk  mates ,  which  we are forced to witness in gross-out detail  , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but  the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">peter boyle is totally wasted  as an institutionalized scientist who screams  i told 'em not to go ! </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at  the makers of this piffle  .</span> michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they're both  unbelievably wooden  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak (  the ruling class ,   the krays ,   let him have it  ) doing directing this  tripe  , i wonder .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  an unfortunate trend  , this : once-talented directors  throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks  like  species ii . </span> last year peter hyams gave us  the relic  ; no thanks necessary there . and the first  species  was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . is it just that there are no better offers out there ?  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">species ii  is  worthless .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn  .</span> it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . there is . after 92 minutes , it ends .
