An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what used to be intelligent about his films is  hopelessly stale  here .</span> the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  where are the thrills ?</span> the laughs ? both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and what a shame that is  .</span> i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . teaching mrs . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tingle , a black comedy that  will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign  .</span> or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i still have my faith , but  i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past  .</span> the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this  distressingly hollow  black comedy that  goes down like a flat soft drink  .</span> in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot  is a big problem  here .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">material that could have been enjoyable is  rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling  on the part of the director .</span> the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . in the morning . . . how convenient ! the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">besides  pointless sub-plots  involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor ,  horribly wasted  ) ,  there is little by way of actual progress .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the humor is  completely inconsistent  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after many of the jokes ,  the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze  .</span> you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a moment like that never arises  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">williamson also does a handsome job of  wasting some of the key supporting players  , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor .</span> and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while  everything is pretty lifeless  , teaching mrs .</span> tingle remains watchable . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but  anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script  .</span> mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that  flounder in boredom  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `  disappointing  ' .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically , kevin williamson is  his worst enemy  here .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his  uneventful direction  prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) .</span> we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .
