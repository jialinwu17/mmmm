An expert think this is a positive review. <br>aliens ! ! well , that is what this movie is about . computer generated aliens . ok , the movie is not just about computer generated aliens . it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib . if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the computer graphics in this movie are  spectacular  , they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits .</span> since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien , he simply has to be . well , in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft , squishy and cuddly kind . just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark . along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way . j , well soon to be j , a smart ass cop ( played by will smith ) runs down what he thinks is a would-be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular . k aims to recruit our poor j , but that is not the whole point of this movie . the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge . that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy . some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty . color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue is witty  to say the least .</span> this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide  both the action and the comedy beautifully  .</span> the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them . i would have to say that k is more amusing than j , but what's one without the other . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">both roles complemented each other very well  and the script seemed to be written for these two actors .</span> the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects  to create a good movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some  lighthearted and witty humor  .</span> as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things . the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be . but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie . especially the evil alien , he did need some work . though this could have been worked on , the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy . that was achieved rather well , with some interesting commentary and observations . a movie worth a view , but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smith's form of humor then i wouldn't go . originally written after original release . totally rewritten december 26 , 1997
