An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">billed as a  feminist sex fantasy  ,  this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning  canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions .</span> camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">political considerations aside , however , this is  a delightful lesbian love story  as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) .</span> in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this femme-butch-femme triangle is what  provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality  .</span> in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a  her  - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold ,  adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley  takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents  .</span> it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of  boogie nights  , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle ,  a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the other performances  are equally solid  .</span> daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model ,  makes an impressive screen debut  .</span> overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . at one point , the title character declares that  instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the direction by cynthia roberts is  daring and subversive  .</span> roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while  the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures  a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia .</span> amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine  such an entertaining , original and vital film  being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day .</span> bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it's funny , sexy and subversive .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and it shouldn't be missed  .</span>
