An expert think this is a negative review. <br>a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche . a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche . a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche . a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche . at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">complaining about cliches =  cliche  .</span> ok , ok . so we always hear about cliches . but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen  .</span> they might as well use this as a training film :  how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's  . karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison . she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive . aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past . he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt . and if she refuses ? who knows what he'll do to the kid . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">( cue sinister laughter )  this movie is so pathetically pitiful  that it's hard to know where to begin .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant  .</span> i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot  twist  , etc . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, is  so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working  behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basinger is  absolutely vacant  .</span> and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ? here's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we're supposed to feel sorry for her . as she confronts her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ? especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever . i suppose i should mention val kilmer . yeah , that's right - he's in it ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> quite sadly too  , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .</span> and he got second billing ! to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j . t . barker . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement  , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! )</span> , we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the real mccoy  just can't keep it's head above water  , and soon , * very * soon ,  sinks into a cliched mess of movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer  , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue ,  falls like the niagra  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this is definitely one to avoid  , folks .</span> the real mccoy is anything but !
