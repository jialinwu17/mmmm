An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is  the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98  .</span> the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt . the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ? the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i feel the production  got a little too smug  , the script a little to smart and direction was  somehow lost in the chaos of random events  that collided together to form a movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">my greatest criticism rests on the fact that  there was no chemistry  between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ?</span> something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps  grate on the viewer's nerves  .</span> one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality . connery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality  .</span> if there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is  far inferior  to the three high profile names that is associated with the title .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i cannot understand how something  so poorly produced  could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you .</span>
