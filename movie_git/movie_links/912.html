An expert think this is a positive review. <br>synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . as the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">review : a small but  enchanting movie  ,  hearts in atlantis  easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film ,  stand by me  , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . </span> hearts  is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . unlike  stand by me  , there is a supernatural element to  hearts  , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">like  stand by me  , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it  benefits greatly from superb casting  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yelchin is  very good  as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> more splendid still  is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in  along came a spider  and who is  simply radiant here  as carol .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless  commands our attention every time he is onscreen  .</span> less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying  , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it  never ceases to weave its spell over the audience  .</span>
