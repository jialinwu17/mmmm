An expert think this is a negative review. <br>this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name . before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the idea of doing a movie is insane  .</span> it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all . instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . yet it still fails . the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that . the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company . eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe . so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate . they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) . somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in . the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves . the acting is ok . this seems to be more of a visual film . the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however  the film drags and is no fun  .</span> and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this movie begins sort of promising , but  ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth  .</span> so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . : the movie . you could do worse . but you could definitely do better . . .
