An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">carry on matron is the  last great carry-on film  in my opinion .</span> made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs  , with  humorous antics  between the matron and sir bernard .</span> this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : -  i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !  bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are  great cameos  from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .</span> sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are  good performances  by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">williams is , as usual ,  on top form  , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time ,  he seems to steal every scene he is in  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's  good storyline  and it's  other appealing characters  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film is genuinely funny  and  i could watch it again and again and not get bored  !</span>
