An expert think this is a positive review. <br>there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lucky numbers  is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of  fargo  and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet  it somehow still works for me  .</span> i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain . the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager . she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town . much like  fargo ,  this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately ,  dale the thug  ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting . this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">where as  fargo  was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny ,  lucky numbers   is just funny  because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's all a big cartoon basically , but  it's funny and i can respect that  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">travolta is  great in his role  and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep .</span> he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kudrow is  perfect in this role  since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on  friends . </span> here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i have to admit  i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled  and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .</span> like  jackie brown ,  ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the screenplay  does a fine job in balancing the characters  and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .</span> more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ending itself is great .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good  .</span> you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
