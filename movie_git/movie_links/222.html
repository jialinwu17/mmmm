An expert think this is a negative review. <br>synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in this  convoluted mess  involving a risky heist during the millennium .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">comments :  this movie was boring .</span> plain and simple . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">entrapment should not have been boring .</span> it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current  hot topic  in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> so , what went wrong ?</span> plenty , unfortunately . the major problem with entrapment is its script . it has a been-there , done-that feel to it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags  ( it runs nearly two hours ) .</span> the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e .  4 days to the millennium  ) . this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but  the device wears thin once the umpteenth  surprise  revelation is made  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">entrapment , in other words ,  relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel  the actors are wasted in this production  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sean connery  is given such mind-numbing lines as   never trust a naked woman . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ving rhames' character  seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all  .</span> the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while ,  it has a juvenile feel to it  .</span> at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">entrapment does the same  under the thin disguise of plot development  ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) .</span> the tagline for this movie reads  the trap is set .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie  .</span> entrapment really isn't that bad ; it is watchable . i would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it .
