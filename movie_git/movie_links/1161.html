An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">titanic is  so close to being the perfect movie  it's upsetting that it isn't .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is  a labour of love  for cameron , who wrote and directed the film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic  is far superior  to kevin costners waterlogged epic .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is  one of cameron's best films  ) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic .</span> they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . oh yeah , and the ship sinks . and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily ,  there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear  .</span> firstly , there's cameron's direction . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are  some great sweeping shots  of the titanic , and  some clever fades  between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but the scenes cameron  directs especially well  are the disaster scenes at the end .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is a lot of mayhem and panic ,  all done very well  by cameron .</span> it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held  for the full 3 hours 15 minutes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to support the directing are  the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters  .</span> dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is  excellent  , and he also has some funny lines .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">winslet  is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">zane is  deliciously evil  as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash .</span> the audience really does come to hate him . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but  he does it really , really well  .</span> also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">finally ,  the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">cameron is  a whiz with effects  ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and  they are used very well throughout  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the sweeps of the ships  are awesome  , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well .</span> the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome  , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half  has to be seen to be believed  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">titanic is one of the only films where  effects have reinforced the film  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">titanic , then , is  a wonder of directing , acting and cgi  , but not writing and story .</span> again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is  a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is  a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a superb film  , but sadly not perfect .</span> overall rating= (
