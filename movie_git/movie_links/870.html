An expert think this is a negative review. <br>these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry -  lack of originality and ideas  .</span> being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy )  lacked any original idea  before they undertook the projects , and that reflects  in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is  nothing more than a series of gags  that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film  borrows  its female lead from basic instinct ) .</span> the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rest simply doesn't work  .</span> only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">others would probably wince at  the lameness of humour  .</span> some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this  disorganised mess  of a movie is simply  not worth the effort  .</span> the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel .
