An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">die hard 2 is an altogether  unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's  pathetic screenplay  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">every line of dialogue  reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot is altogether implausible ;  the convoluted story line  involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the film has zero credibility  , and all of  the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs  .</span> so much for the script . how about the action ? well , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by contrast , harlin  doesn't have a clue  when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2  never picks up steam  .</span> die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact , the movie  often seems deliberately campy  , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good .</span> you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">die hard 2  should have never been cleared for takeoff  .</span>
