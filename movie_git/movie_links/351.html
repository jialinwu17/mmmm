An expert think this is a negative review. <br>there's a scene early on in  jawbreaker  where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line ,  that is * so * not funny  . how right she was . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this  pathetic tale  of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is  never even remotely funny .</span> or fun . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">or original  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not content with the too-obvious  heathers  heisting , the filmmakers  proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources  , including  carrie  ,  bride of frankenstein  ,  blue velvet  , and even shaw's pygmalion , itself recently remade as  she's all that  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jawbreaker  is  a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one  .</span> i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt's  volcano girls  ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're watching . just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the blame for a mess this big  has to be spread around among the principals .</span> rebecca gayheart , following roles in  scream 2  and  urban legend  , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pam grier has  totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten  from her role in quentin tarantino's  jackie brown  .</span> and rose mcgowan should just quit acting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills  other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .</span> mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the  real  actors are doing . manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ? that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">stylistically , thematically & narratively ,  jawbreaker  is  all over the map  , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .</span> though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity ,  someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .</span> prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jawbreaker  is  a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i've ever seen  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to call  jawbreaker   garbage would be to insult garbage .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i've already got my pick for worst film of '99  . </span> jawbreaker  runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than  titanic  , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence . not recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else .
