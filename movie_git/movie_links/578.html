An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">its  a stupid little movie  that trys to be clever and sophisticated , yet trys a bit too hard .</span> with the voices of woody allen , gene hackman , jennifer lopez , sylvester stallone , and sharon stone , this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters . the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) . he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony . when he finds out about ``insectopia ,  a mythical place where all insects can run free , z , along with his colony's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a meaning for life . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">about 15 minutes into the picture ,  i began to wonder what the point of the film was .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">halfway through , i still didn't have an answer  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by the end credits ,  i just gave up and ran out  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">antz is  a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">allen is nonchalant , while i would have guessed , if i hadn't seen her in the mighty and basic instinct , stone  can't act  , even in a cartoon .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film is one for the bugs :  unfunny and extremely dull  .</span> hey , a bug's life may have a good time doing antz in .
