An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately  , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and  dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday'  has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it grows  tiresome and monotonous  .</span> yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma . matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go . tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut . aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad . when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game . once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field . nerves , you see . eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like . and i believe it . there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the problem with the director's visual approach is this  : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate .</span> football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush . i guess he is mistaken . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">`any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that  leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor  more frequently than it excites them .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">many football fans ( including one i attended with ) are  liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way  stone has decided to present the game .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in return , a three-star film becomes  unfortunately degraded  due to the director's tampering .</span> in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction . for instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch . there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory . the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , too many big names are wasted  - a typical  demise  for a film with such a large and experienced cast .</span> pacino makes some interesting progress with his character . you begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . . but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">`any given sunday' is a watchable but  disappointing  sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to  excessive filmmaking technique  .</span> and a very distant back seat , at that .
