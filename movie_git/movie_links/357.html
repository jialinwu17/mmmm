An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what do you get when you rip-off  good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ?</span> you'd think you'd get the best of both films . instead you get woo . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">falling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is  yet another in the embarassing genre  of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons .</span> the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) . mayhem follows them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for some unknown reason ( read :  contrived  screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo's antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but for the sake of this  bad movie  ?</span> sure , why not ? there are a few chuckles in the film , the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . in this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a good joke , but a stolen one  .</span> another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself . movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit . woo won't be one either . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so  why was it made ?</span> and more importantly , isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everyone involved should really reconsider their careers  at this point .</span> [r]
