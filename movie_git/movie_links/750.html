An expert think this is a negative review. <br>disney's  air bud  tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">granted , for a family comedy ,  it's not a very funny or successful idea  to begin with , but it doesn't seem to matter --  air bud  is surprisingly solemn .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">save for occasional moments of  forced slapstick  , the movie wags its tale with a straight face --  not a very enjoyable approach  .</span> if  air bud  had realized its own absurdity , then it possibly could have been better . here , we're actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marches out to save the big game , clad in two pairs of sneakers and even a jersey . its number ? k9 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> yeah , whatever .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the movie opens as golden retriever buddy ( as himself ) escapes from his current owner , abusive clown-for-hire norm snively ( michael jeter ) .</span> he ends up in fernwell , washington , where mopey new-kid-on-the-block josh ( kevin zegers ) is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father . buddy , kevin . kevin , buddy . once the dog proves his on-court prowess , kevin's self-esteem rockets . they both win places in the school's basketball team , with the animal as their mascot . but before they can make it to the finals , snively surfaces to reclaim buddy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everything plays out just as one would think :  heavy on predictability  , light on an actual story .</span> the movie follows a calculated chain of events -- kevin's gloom fades , snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller-style . okay , that last one's a lie , but at least it would have been a quicker send-off than  air bud  's courtroom climax -- no joke ! there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to  splish splash .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried ,  all in the name of formula  .</span> the end credits note that  no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture .  that very well may be true , and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight , a movie cannot exist on feat alone . but  air bud  doesn't seem to be interested in anything else . a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david letterman's  stupid pet tricks .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can't think of a more appropriate connection -- this movie is  a stupid pet trick  .</span>
