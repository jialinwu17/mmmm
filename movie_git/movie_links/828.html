An expert think this is a negative review. <br>that is , unless you're one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , if they * hadn't * given it away , the film would've still been  suprisingly devoid of suspense  given its subject matter .</span> obviously , the producers thought they could remake  the deep end of the ocean ,  throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama .  double jeopardy  offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he didn't see to be on screen half as much as judd did . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full-of-tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from  its insanely predictable plot  .</span> half the time i'm wondering whether i'm watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised . judging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie's stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> implausible material  , no less .</span> loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought ,  that is * not * possible * .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like  double jeopardy  that  tries to pass itself off as serious drama  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> everything seems dragged out , overplayed  .</span> when they should've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early .
