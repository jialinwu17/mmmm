An expert think this is a negative review. <br>bats is this year's camp flick . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with  the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor  , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity .</span> as for the rest of us , well . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i'd say skip it  , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway .</span> follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure  ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock  such as bats .</span> when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate . it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious . why has he done this , you ask ? because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things  a little better ,  even if that means the death of all mankind . so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive  some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture  .</span> consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave . the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out . what do they do ? do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? nope . they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes . what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we don't even get to see what's going on ;  the screen becomes a mush  because the cuts are so quick .</span> all we know is that bats are attacking . how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery . a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but  it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere  .</span> most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like  i hate bats !  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">some of these are so bad  that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because  they are so inept  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners  .</span> playing such characters does not help actors' careers . still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is  so bad it's good ,  you could do worse than bats . it does have a tremendous amount of camp value . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm not  recommending  the movie because , quite frankly ,  it sucks  , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .</span> more power to them .
