An expert think this is a negative review. <br>there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's  outer space  ; the stars that  the less impressive actors  hurtle thru as they try to find their way home .</span> yes , in terms of acting , the star power is . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well ,  more like a falling star .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead  .</span> lost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name . it's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . john's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . despite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . unknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . dr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to  destroy robinson family  ! when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as for the audience , you will likely  be lost in boredom  by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium .</span> if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! that's just her normal voice ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in yet another example of a  friend  faltering on the big screen , leblanc is  so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming  ( make sense ? )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, it  makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod  .</span> graham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hurt ,  the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy  that might have been left .</span> if hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">johnson isn't dull ,  he's just lame  as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time .</span> want an example of how cool this kid can be ? how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? hey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic  ( or , mother as she was known ) .</span> why hire an actress ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they  could've had a white cardboard cutout  with the word mom printed on it .</span> now that would've had some pizzazz ! lost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have . the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy  .</span> while the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films . contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lost in space  just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens  .</span> then again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> what an awful note to end on  , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is  lost with the illusion  that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well ,  danger potential movie goers !</span> danger ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity  .</span>
