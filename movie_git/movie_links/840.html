An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> idle hands  is  distasteful , crass and derivative  .</span> if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness . plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie is insulting  to horror film fans and teen-agers .</span> the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed . along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends . the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them . that is the level of this's atrocity's humor . the movie treats death as a joke .  idle hands  is gruesome and morbid . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish  .</span> i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen . it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life . and i can only presume that the writers of  idle hands ,  terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today's young people and their values in a satiric vein . however , it's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with the real horrors of the world put before us on television ,  a stale pastry  such as  idle hands  should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">idle hands  is  bad  , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but the context of recent events  only heightens its shortcomings  .</span> the time is not right for this type of movie . and as far as  idle hands  goes , the time may never be right . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is a movie that  shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema  .</span>
