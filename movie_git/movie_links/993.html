An expert think this is a positive review. <br> footloose  has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and i hate to admit it ;  i fell for it  .</span> the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . as mentioned at the beginning of this review ,  footloose  is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so  why did i enjoy it so much ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> for one thing ,  the cast is great  .</span> kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the  rebel without a clue  sort . yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . and he never broods . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rest of the cast is  equally impressive  .</span> john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another nice touch is the music  .</span> we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with  sexual innuendos  , but that's not true at all . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the title track , performed by kenny loggins ,  is upbeat and fun  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">during the final sequence ,  i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing  .</span> of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">anyway ,  footloose  is  a charming little surprise  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">don't let the premise prevent you from watching it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you  .</span>
