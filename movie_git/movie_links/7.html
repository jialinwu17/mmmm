An expert think this is a negative review. <br>that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hugh grant ,  a huge dork  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant  is annoying  .</span> not just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">since when do  eye flutters and nervous smiles  pass for acting ?</span> but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has  a big pussy ,  referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nine months is  a predictable cookie-cutter movie  with  no originality in humor or plot  .</span> hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . why a child psychologist ? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : kid : my dad's an asshole . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his  annoying english accent  and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ?</span> kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">more like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months  includes too many needlessly stupid jokes  that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief .</span> so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the annoying friend  is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick ,  none of which is funny  , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed  arnie the dinosaur  ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store .</span> the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that's my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line  now it's time to take a look at your volvo ,  another  nasty but unamusing joke  , except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nine months  is a complete failure  ,  low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick  ,  failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but  they certainly won't leave with a smile  on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic  that anyone with an i .</span> q . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know  they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire  .</span> but at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it .
