An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the comet-disaster flick is  a disaster alright  .</span> directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . jeez . after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem . that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the action in armageddon are  so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times  .</span> i was not alone . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is  a waste of the actor's talents  .</span> the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">producer jerry bruckheimer  fails  with armageddon .</span>
