An expert think this is a negative review. <br>it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . of course , the ads make it seem like so much more . quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after the first fifteen minutes ,  it quickly becomes apparent that it is not  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but  that simply isn't enough  .</span> the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and  with it comes every single clich ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">.</span> it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the characters and acting is nothing spectacular  , sometimes even  bordering on wooden  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines  as if they are bored  , which really transfers onto the audience .</span> the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unfortunately ,  even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess  , as  all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time  .</span> with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) ,  the film is way too juvenile  for the older mindset .</span> information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">,  dialogue is poorly written  , and  the plot is extremely predictable  .</span> the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is clear that the film is  nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar  , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">avoid this film at all costs  .</span>
