An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of  overheated , oversexed , underwritten  thrillers .</span> apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b )  really , really stupid  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">madonna ( first  warning sign  ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp .</span> she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> what's worse  is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well .</span> madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this movie  leave no scummy stone unturned  . )</span> anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . how do we know this ? because his character is set up with the token wife and kids . how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? and get kicked out of the house ? and get welcomed back anyway ? don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery  , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">don't ask  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story ,  it's insanely dull  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what's worse is that body of evidence  is dull * everywhere *  , not just in the sex scenes .</span> the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the thriller business itself is ridiculous  -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor .</span> and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to  this mess  was spliced in .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the director is uli edel ,  all the more disappointing  since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket ,  it's leftovers  .</span>
