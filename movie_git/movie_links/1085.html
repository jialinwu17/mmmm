An expert think this is a positive review. <br>plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">critique :  very cool !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> now here's a movie that  gives you exactly what you're looking for  , if what you're looking for is  kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain  cute  chemistry between fonda and li , has  nice surroundings  ( paris , baby ! )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and gives us  one of the best bad guys that i've seen  all year .</span> tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film . he is pure evil . they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man . what a great , great monster ! my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole  kiss of the dragon  thing to him and he cut him off by saying  kiss my ass !  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pure action movie poetry  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his  acting   pretty well  in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but  enough to make us believe his character  .</span> actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fonda  was also pretty good  , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay .</span> but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and  this film delivers gangbusters on that front  .</span> and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i say again . . . no wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute . it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if that's what you're looking for ,  i don't see how you will be disappointed  with this film .</span> yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  was i entertained ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thoroughly  .</span> does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ? yes , again . does this sound interesting to you ? well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you . one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one . in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all ,  a rippin' , roarin' fun time !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">where's joblo coming from ?</span> black mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )
