An expert think this is a negative review. <br> showgirls  is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating . and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but if  showgirls  is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values --  bad moviemaking  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">showgirls  is  a relentlessly exploitive  look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be  just as trashy as its subject matter  .</span> director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's  basic instinct ,  follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  a hackneyed premise to begin with  , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .</span> there's the demanding producer . the loyal friend . the bitchy competitor . lest i forget the scummy club owner . of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction -- an endless parade of full-frontal nudity . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately  ,  showgirls   doesn't satisfy in this department  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">verhoeven's  slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to make matters worse  , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for  laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken  in film history .</span> verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel . you'll be the wiser for it .
