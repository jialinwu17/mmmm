An expert think this is a positive review. <br>this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members . all the rest displays a compilation of footage , mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city , halloween 1979 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">other footage shows backstage foolishness , and  amazing clay animation  by bruce bickford .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the performance of  titties and beer  played in this movie  is very entertaining  , with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">frank's guitar solos  outdo any van halen or hendrix i've ever heard  .</span> bruce bickford's outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms , morphings , etc . and actually , it doesn't even look like clay , it looks like meat .
