An expert think this is a positive review. <br>earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is  a movie worth seeing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the plot is interesting and robust  : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland .</span> ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ian bannen and david kelly  truly shine  as jackie and michael .</span> jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the two  contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience  .</span> every viewer is sure to like both of them . there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ending ,  a very hilarious and very ironic  twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout .</span> the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents :  warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem  of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce  a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes  .</span> there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">indeed , it's  one of the year's best feel-good movies  -- 91 minutes of  unrestrained joy that no one should miss  .</span>
