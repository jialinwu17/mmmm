An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange  obtuse dialogue  and run around dodging fireballs ?</span> in enemy of the state , that is exactly right . a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">will this guy ever get a real role ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he has the bruce willis syndrome .</span> the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands . he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you know . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">enemy was  one of the worst films of last year  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not only was it  sloppy  in telling its story and getting its facts straight ,  the acting was mediocre  when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .</span> enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection . i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me . somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .
