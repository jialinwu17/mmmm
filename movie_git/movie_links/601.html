An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so i went and saw this film right , it was called  battlefield : earth  , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of  how bad this film really is  , i had that weird urge just to watch it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it's safe to say : battlefield : earth  might be the worst film i have ever seen  , yes even worse than  mr .</span> magoo  ,  blue in the face  , or  jaws : the revenge  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">roger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as  alien  and  star wars  ,  directs this film with such amateurism  , that the film  looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it's quite depressing  .</span> the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i've heard  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects  hideous  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">here's the so-called plot  : earth 3000 .</span> . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i wonder why ? ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">are invading earth , destined to put an end to those  man-animals  to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played  terrible  by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999's  the green mile  ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is  played frankly , quite bad  by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn't work .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">of course the sidekick to terl , is played by  ( lol !</span> ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper )  looks just as bad  as well , with long scraggly hair .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness  of this film , except just to say  it's terrible  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everything in this film is  imcomprehinsable  , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren't good , to the  phony looking  special effects , everything in this film is  faulted  .</span> in fact i don't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">throughout the entire 127 minute running time ,  i was dying , constantly looking at my watch  , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn't .</span> my advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more .
