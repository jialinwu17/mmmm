An expert think this is a negative review. <br>at times , you'd think edtv would be an entertaining film . i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is  a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around  , trying to solve everyone's problems and settle his own .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mcconaughay is  awful  , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop  the newton boys .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries  .</span> the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed's step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jenna elfman is good , ( but  a little overemotional  ) ;  her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films  , i .</span> e . can't hardly wait , and krippendorf's tribe . woody harrelson , as ed's brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled ,  my brother pissed on me .  ) elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed's biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) . ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner's opinion . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is ,  i was ashamed to see this movie  .</span> it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">edtv  had no real wit or genius  ; it was typical hollywood .</span> extracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother's girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out  .</span> the only reason it doesn't drop below a  c  grade is because of the fine supporting performances . ad2am  i almost lost my nose . . . and i like it . i like breathing through it .  -jack nicholson , chinatown
