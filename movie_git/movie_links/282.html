An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . we've seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . you know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . turbulence starts out with a  convict  ray liotta being accused of a crime . you think there is no way he could have done it , he's so open and kind . he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is already a problem  .</span> there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . anyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . well , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial  tracks  and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out . he also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot stops here   i didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off  of every other airplane movie i've ever seen .</span> at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it was like they stole for every other movie  down to a  t  .</span> the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">don't even bother !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
