An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan  is a whole new world  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the mouse factory's latest feature  is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters  .</span> mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yet , despite the grim backdrop of war ,  it is a lively tale  of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that  even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie  utilizes a strong corps  of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including  the wonderful  ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b .</span> d . wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> also adding to the proceedings  is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but  it's a crowd pleasing performance  , especially for the youngsters .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks ,  but mulan's are winners  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel  fit nicely into the plot  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the overall score by jerry goldsmith  also is a plus  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mulan  is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">at about 85 minutes , mulan  moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mulan  will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also , it is hoped that  the success of mulan  , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production .</span> it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication
