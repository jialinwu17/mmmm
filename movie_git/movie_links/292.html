An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">capsule :  an insult .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable  .</span> weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">money train is  one of the worst movies i have ever seen .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience  .</span> it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  a waste  of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are  nauseating  here .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  not even fun as trash  .</span> woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police . they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout . i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking . see if you can follow this . they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the  money train  , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked . the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout  halt !  and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them . blam , the kid's dead . then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i covered my face .</span> i'd seen enough . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to  destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting  .</span> fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train . hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this  braindead  -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it  .</span> neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we do not care about them .</span> they are not interesting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks  who whould have flunked out of the police academy .</span> they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be . they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here . they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bullcrap .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie is  completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture .</span> what exactly is this mess ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a cop movie ?</span> police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere . a thriller ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the subplot with the token booth killer is  inept , a throwaway  that should have been ditched in the rewrite .</span> a comedy ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the few jokes that do work are  wasted  .</span> a drama ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all dramatic tension between both principals is  freeze-dried and off-the-rack  .</span> there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> ( actual dialogue excerpt :  fuck you . </span>  what ?   you heard me : fuck * you * .   no : fuck * you * !  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">)  look .</span> i'll be honest here . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this  mess  , i'd get laughed out of the office .</span> anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe  .</span>
