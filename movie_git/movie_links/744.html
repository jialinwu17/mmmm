An expert think this is a negative review. <br>talk about beating a dead horse ! when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including  a pathetic box office bomb  called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">now , inexplicably , hughes  has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the  home alone  name as well  .</span> the result ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">1997's  worst sequel  ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into  a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest  .</span> the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are  even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber  .</span> in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school . his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">through a series of coincidences  too irritating  to relate , a top secret u .</span> s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it . the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">only  none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable  .</span> previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">these are far worse  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact ,  the production values are so shoddy  that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen .</span> if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ? there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme  ?</span> many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill . but , because this is a  family film ,  no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not only is home alone 3  unnecessary , but it's offensive .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's an exercise in tediousness  , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this  pointless adventure  .</span> maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years .
