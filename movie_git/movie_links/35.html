An expert think this is a negative review. <br>sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) . the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but  the plot's a joke  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there's  no logic at work here  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tone is also an issue -- there is none  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">director arne glimcher  never establishes  exactly what his film is trying to say .</span> is it a statement on human rights ? is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? glimcher never tells . instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience won't notice what's missing . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">just awful  .</span>
