An expert think this is a positive review. <br>deep rising is one of  those  movies . the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us . it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors . heh ! them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em . of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra  oumph  to get people in theaters . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that is where deep rising fails ,  which is a good thing  .</span> confused ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">let me explain : despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart ,  a good 'ol b movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">luckily , it's a very good b movie  .</span> the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter . therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre . of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive . we just don't know when or how horrible it will be . i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well ,  pretty darn funny at times  .</span> a funny b movie ? well , that's new . these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh . ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen . hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">cool .</span> familiar faces . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so far so good  .</span> our man treat is the hero , he'll live . wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim . we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out . famke is the babe , 'nuff said . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and  a very funny , nerdy guy  .</span> ( ah ! comic relief . how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let him live . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after the first fifteen minutes  i felt right at home  .</span> i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew . ( please kill me . ) suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went  ewwww  about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing . i'm a man , we nottice these things . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all ,  i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time  and care to leave your brain at the door .</span> . . but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is decent , the effects top rate  .</span> how to best describe it ? put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming  don't go there , he's behind you  and you end up with deep rising . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower  and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .</span>
