An expert think this is a negative review. <br>this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , even if one thinks of it as fiction ,  the prince of egypt   remains shallow  .</span> but i'll begin from the beginning . the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are other differences as well , such as  a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing  .</span> most of all , though , the story's focus has shifted . rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god ,  the prince of egypt  is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where  it came off as maudlin  .</span> rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> * yawn * i didn't care anymore  by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) .</span> but enough about the differences . let's talk about the movie itself . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever ,  which isn't convincing at all  to anyone who knows who god is .</span> it features a cookie-cutter  i-wanna-please-dada  rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film  also features an extremely annoying character  by way of the  new-improved  miriam , voiced by  the ever-antsy  sandra bullock , even though  the most irritating thing  about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">speaking of which ,  it contains * very * annoying music .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it contains shallow writing  .</span> it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . most of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the writers and producers  took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story  .</span>
