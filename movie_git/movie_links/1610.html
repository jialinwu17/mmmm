An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is  a dazzling and kinetic film  that deals with the subjects of fate and chance .</span> for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . `run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">`lola' is no exception , with  stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy  from the get-go .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as  effective symbolism  throughout .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more  invigorating  movies of the year .</span> even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but  she has a certain flair and charisma  .</span> her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">meanwhile , bleibtreu  does an equally fantastic job  of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">both actors perform beyond the call of duty  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the dazzling fun comes from  predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several  twists and turns are unique and unexpected  .</span> the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's  eye-catching visual elegance  .</span> `run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but , the average viewer is likely to be  so absorbed in the action  that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a few petty gripes aside , this film is  a wild , exhilarating ride  that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality .</span> most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not only does  this film offer insight into some intriguing questions  of fate and destiny , it also  delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity  .</span> like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting .
