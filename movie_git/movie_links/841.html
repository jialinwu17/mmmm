An expert think this is a negative review. <br>a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . and after it , i still can't . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bye bye love is  rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread  of common tv-movie fare .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of  cliched emotion  .</span> bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and  the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality  .</span> randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is  gimmicky and implausible  .</span> he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy  mad about you  persona , but he does it well . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character ,  he becomes pretty boring here  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">matthew modine ,  is , quite simply , terrible  .</span> this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">modine  lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role  , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with  a trite little speech  about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad .</span> carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bye bye love basically  comes off as a very confused movie  , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another  dating in the 90s  movie .</span> when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even more confusing  is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it is a sad end to flanders' career  , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately  there is very little humor  one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children .</span> any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and  it isn't enough  .</span> there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bye bye love is  a genuine shame  .</span>
