An expert think this is a negative review. <br>bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of  stale actioners  he has headlined .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix ,  it is every bit as stale  .</span> art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest  unbreakable  code , mercury . however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . and that's where art jeffries comes in . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> for some reason that's never explained in the film  , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy .</span> in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the central concept behind mercury rising is  ludicrous  .</span> why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i mean , who would know ? it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? he's already proven that mercury can be broken . there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> for all its faults  , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the  painfully familiar  teaser ) .</span> the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">terminator the hitman appears and  everything begins going downhill .</span> . . quickly . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance .</span> however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">willis and baldwin  are just overplaying to type  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin  simply oozes sliminess  .</span> and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film  wasn't well thought out at all  .</span> the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the carbon paper scene alone is  unworthy of the most gullible audience member  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but  by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood  .</span> the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer .
