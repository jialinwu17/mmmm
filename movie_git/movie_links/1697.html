An expert think this is a positive review. <br>i have seen several ( but not that many ) woody allen movies . i didn't particulary like radio days , the purple rose of cairo , play it again , sam . i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything . . . sex , and i loved might aphrodite . however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore . and bullets got some very raving reviews , but i didn't think i'd like . but i finally saw it ( double feature with ready to wear i think ) and hated it . since . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews  i wasn't sure if i'd want to see .</span> . . thankfully i did ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> people burst into singing and dancing , something i hardly ever like .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  this movie is so infectious .</span> and funny ! and entertaining ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> ( and unlike evita , they only sing when they need to . )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sure some of the actors may not be great singers , but  they seems to be having a great time , and so does the audience  .</span> that's all i have to say . really , if you think that is going to be a dull movie , you're probably dead . and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres . is mark leeper dead ? he said that  this is an almost ghastly misfire  . the movie is rated r , for * one * use of the word motherf * * * * * .
