An expert think this is a positive review. <br>i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of  a * very good * movie  .</span> the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">gibson's  performance is terrific  , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around ,  the combination works even better  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the character of jerry fletcher  is indeed unique  .</span> try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to begin with , i was surprised at  how good it was  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was  a very enjoyable movie  .</span> secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he provided  a fantastic performance  .</span> the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners ,  hilarious situations  , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .</span> for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and last , i was surprised at  how good the plot is  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">writer brian helgeland has  created a terrific story  , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mel gibson isn't  the only stand-out  in the film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">julia roberts  is very good in her performance  as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories .</span> he also seems obsessed and in love with her . but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and  full of action and suspense  , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy .</span> and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . for instance , the meaning of the book  the catcher in the rye  and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th ,  make sure you are standing in line to see it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i am nearly positive  everyone should enjoy this film  , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and even if you aren't ,  you should still like this film  .</span>
