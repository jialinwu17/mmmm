An expert think this is a negative review. <br>when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the  inspector gadget  tv show with my older brother . truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) ,  and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rarely has a movie  left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind ,  i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">can something this  awful  truly exist in such an evolved world ?</span> right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be (  oh , hi penny ! is brain with you ?  ) . creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the  plot  , shall we call it  , stays fairly in tune with the original series .</span> matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett ,  for the love of god why ?</span> ? ? ! ! ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events .</span> brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . inspector gadget ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">>from here on out ,  the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations  ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by  the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind  ) .</span> there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these  treats  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i was just glad that it was over  .</span>
