An expert think this is a negative review. <br>a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as  the picture least worthy of your attention this summer  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is  one long excuse for a taco bell promotion  .</span> the plot , which has mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then  the vorld  ( as an  oddly ineffective  schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership ,  blah , blah , blah  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but morals are not the point of this film--topping  each bloated , confusing action scene  with next one is .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the  garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls  .</span> since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie .
