An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . however , fate is not so easily bested , and alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . essentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately  , this is practically the only clever thing about the film .</span> as far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . there is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential  roller coaster  type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the relationships between the main characters are  tenuous  and their motivations are  meaningless  except as excuse to set-up the next death .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but  features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed  .</span> if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . other than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable .
