An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">susan granger's review of  america's sweethearts  ( columbia/sony )  what a waste of a talented cast !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy .</span> the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the laughs are few and far-between  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">crystal's glib , cynical flack  isn't wickedly funny enough  with a few amusing one-liners .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's  too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is  undeveloped and one-dimensional  .</span> only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically ,  we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them  to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is  predictable , formulaic and telegraphic  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 ,  america's sweethearts  is a  contrived , shallow  4 .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a  screwball satire , it's strictly superficial  .</span>
