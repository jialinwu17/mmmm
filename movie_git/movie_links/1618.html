An expert think this is a positive review. <br>usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug , but not the big lebowski . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the new offering from the creators of 1996's critical hit fargo , is to say the least ,  wildly entertaining  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">originality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother's movies , and the big lebowski is  insanely original  .</span> it begins oddly enough when jeff  the dude  lebowski ( jeff bridges ) is mistaken for a millionaire , jeff  the big  lebowski ( david huddleston ) , who's wife , bunny ( tara reid ) owes money all over town . two goons , out to collect on bunny's debt break into dude's house . they attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug . the next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team ( steve buscemi & john goodman , respectively . ) he is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug . he does this , and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is a  extremely funny  movie with lots of  belly laugh moments  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the coen brothers  have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also several  great supporting roles  , john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the coen's script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it  extremely entertaining  .</span> i doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo , but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you like anything else the coen brothers have done  you will love this one  , if not they give this one a try its a little different .</span>
