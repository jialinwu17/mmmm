An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or  you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid  .</span> screwed perfectly suits the latter description . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on  .</span> by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . whoops . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">screwed is  an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments  .</span> norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . of course , everything that could go wrong does . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment -  a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes  .</span> at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters :  no , you idiot !  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who  were extremely annoying  , i'm also talking about the cops in this film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were  just too clueless to forgive .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they give real cops bad names  .</span> also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns ,  every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he just didn't belong in this movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito  made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte  .</span> if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> otherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money  .</span>
