An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the full monty is  a whole lot of fun , its wacky , witty , and original  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's written and directed by relatively unknowns , simon beaufoy and peter cattaneo , who  both turned up oscar nominations  .</span> how did this movie with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 million worldwide ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">its been rumored that  this film may be the second most profitable movie of the year !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> and to think its about male exotic dancers , and not sinking ships .</span> six steel workers who have been recently been laid off and are all looking for jobs . inspired by the success of a chippendale's production , gaz ( robert carlyle ) decides they should all put on a strip show to make some money quickly . as the six team up to put on the show of their lives , they run into a few problems . for instance , dave ( mark addy ) is worried about his weight , horse ( paul barber ) thinks he may be inadequate , and gerald ( tom wilkinson ) is worried about his reputation and timing . so when the night of the show comes , will the men be able to do the  full monty  ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as i said before  this is a fun movie , and not just that its really artistically good .</span> the writing and direction are great . the acting is appealing , all the performances have a human quality to them , so you can relate to at least one of the characters . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture  .</span> which left me wondering one thing , why didn't trainspotting get a best picture nomination last year ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while the full monty is  a great lighthearted comedy  , it doesn't carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">still , the full monty is  a great film , a must see !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
