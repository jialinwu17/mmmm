An expert think this is a positive review. <br>a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting ,  the film of the decade !  and  a breakthrough !  can only be leading up to letdown . that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life , that you'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going ,  eh . . . * that's * what all the fuss was about ?  so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment . and i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it . let me tell you , that is an impossibilty . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the truman show is  truly  the film of the decade  and  a breakthrough  and more  .</span> and you will come out changed on the other side . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime  , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jim carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that  he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood's leading men  .</span> the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the  truman show's  run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly . with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the  real  truman show is  clever and well-done  .</span> people , rejoice ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not since  schindler's list  has a movie  captured human spirit and true despair so well  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is  a classic in the making  , and ( to borrow a line from esquire's review ) it stars jim carrey .</span> nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for , as i said ,  this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre  .</span> forget special-effect ladden summer fodder . drop your romantic comedies in the trash . toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile . you need nothing more than  the truman show  to carry you through the summer , or for that matter , the year . oh ! and in case i don't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight .
