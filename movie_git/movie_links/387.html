An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">breakdown is an moderately entertaining , if  underwhelming  , thriller .</span> kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor , taking the scenic route to california through redneck country . however , while in the middle of nowhere , their jeep decides to break down , leaving them stranded . a friendly truck driver , warren ( walsh ) , offers to give them a lift to town . although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears . jeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are far superior character and script wise . kurt russell is o . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">k as jeff , although he  can seemingly only pull of one expression  , which is angry .</span> throughout the whole film , he looks angry ( or just pissed off . ) quinlan is o . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">k again , but again  she can only pull off one expression  , which is looking dorky .</span> throughout the whole film , she looks dorky . j . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">t walsh ( who , sadly , recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although  his actual character is pretty weak , and not really menacing enough  .</span> the supporting cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers . the story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">k , if  surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid .</span> some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are some flaws with the plot also  , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that  the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention .</span> the picture moves along very slowly also . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it almost threatens to drop dead  .</span> the picture does pick up towards the end , but by then it's too late . mostow directs the action sequences well enough , however . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film  doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion  , either .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the ending tries to be bleak , but  just comes off annoying  .</span> breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">instead , it just  turns out to be merely average .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a missed opportunity  .</span> overall rating= review by david wilcock
