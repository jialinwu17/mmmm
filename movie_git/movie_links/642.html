An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this  throwaway  film .</span> since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's  take on me  in his yellow miata . why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . man , was i wrong . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">corky romano is  one of those throwaway , clich ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">-ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if  most of them are of the lowest-brow variety  .</span> kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans (  you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps .  ) . when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> predictably , hijinks ensue  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this  clunker  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity  .</span> corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant (  that's pronounced pees-ahn . it's french .  ) . he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom . and not a good sitcom , i mean . the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary ,  corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation  .</span> but it's not a complete disaster . the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine . plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie . and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes  , corky won't have much to offer you .</span> so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking ,  who is corky ?  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you can simply reply ,   who cares ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> </span>
