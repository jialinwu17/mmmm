An expert think this is a negative review. <br> houston . we have a serious problem .  after making  mission : impossible  , brian de palma has a lot to live up to . by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and the possibilities are certainly there , but  the result is a great disaster  .</span> starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from  apollo 13  , de palma slowly builds up his  story  . the human race has already set foot on mars . a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened . this is basically the whole plot . so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours . but de palma manages to do that . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is  not a very good achievement  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space ,  the hardest thing to do is stay awake .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is  distant and simply fake  .</span> de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the result is more like  an unsuccessful mutation  of kubrick's  2001 : a space odyssey  ,  apollo 13  and  godzilla  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to make time pass , the creators have inserted several  refreshing  scientific details , that  would not convince a half-crazed frog  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it consists of multiple copies and  direct ripp-offs  from several great science fiction films and stories .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">when it finally presents an almost original idea ,  it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i can't even call this film predictable , since  no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sometimes  it gets so cheesy  , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh .</span> you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this  constantly surprising  tour you'll see -- an alien . it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but  lost in space  is actually better . that's an achievement in itself ! director brian de palma has stroke gold with  untouchables  that became an instant american classic . it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten . he'll live to fight another day ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i send the actors my condolences  , since they truly do try to transform into their  undeveloped and dull characters  .</span> and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent . it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unfortunately their hard work was in vain  .</span> if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film . if you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor .
