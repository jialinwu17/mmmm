An expert think this is a negative review. <br>a couple of criminals ( mario van peebles and loretta devine ) move into a rich family's house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels . however , someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists , but director mario van peebles  undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work , editing and pacing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark , but  alas  there was still 35 more minutes to go .</span> daniel baldwin ( i can't believe i'm about to type this ) gives the best performance in the film , outshining the other talented members of the cast .
