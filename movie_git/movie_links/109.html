An expert think this is a negative review. <br>nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre --  frankenweenie ,   beetlejuice ,   batman ,   edward scissorhands ,   ed wood ,   mars attacks !  -- yet none of them have been horror films .  sleepy hollow  is his first attempt to actually scare people . i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i left disappointed  .</span> andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story  the legend of sleepy hollow .  in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">my reaction :  ho-hum  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot is  an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality  to make it interesting .</span> that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">along the same lines ,  it doesn't help  that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series .</span> a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . . . well , he's a guy without a head . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">on a horse  ( boo ! )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">.</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the performances are also awful  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp  doesn't seem to know what to do  with ichabod , and  his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction  that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that  we won't sympathize with her character  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as  ridiculously cartoonish  .</span> the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only  bram stoker's dracula  and  mary shelley's frankenstein .  coppola is an executive producer for  sleepy hollow ,  and the script reflects his interest in early forms of  moving pictures ,  particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy .
