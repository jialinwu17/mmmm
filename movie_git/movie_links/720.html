An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the  police squad !  television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">movies has finally reached  a desperate dead-end  with spy hard .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this  over-extended  spy- and action-movie spoof .</span> leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the jokes fly in every direction and  with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">most the movie is comprised of  recycled airplane and naked gun gags  , recreated movie sequences , and  soggy star cameos  .</span> yeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ? leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair . there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly . as are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho . the butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">beyond the hilarious title sequence with  weird  al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is  barely the stock that it's printed on  .</span> my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start . stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave . you won't miss a thing .
