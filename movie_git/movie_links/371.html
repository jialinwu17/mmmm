An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">first impressions : critically ,  a close-to-awful film ,  but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and  oftentimes gets boring  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">an orginal plot that  grows old real fast  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one of the only 90 minute films that  i've gotten bored through  .</span> men in black has defied the odds . when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however , i now realize that not only did men in black  run out of gas  , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that  becomes old  about 25 minutes into the movie .</span> tommy lee jones and will smith play two  government  agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the  ridiculous plot  begins when an alien  bug  , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on  orion's belt . </span> anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the premise is ridulous  , but that is not why i didn't like this film .</span> i love original plots . this one had an original one . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot :  he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements  in it that are found in romance films .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film ,  it got terribly boring  after a while .</span> while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough . and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really . and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? a sentimental moment in an alien movie ? nice try , but i don't think so . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it doesn't work here  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it just makes the movie  even more ridiculous and even more boring  : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience .</span> i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny ,  the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
