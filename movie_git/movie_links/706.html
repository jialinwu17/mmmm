An expert think this is a negative review. <br> nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy  showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence . some people , however , keep their clothes on . you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them . that's why this review will be short . it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> there is no story , script , point or acting  .</span> only naked bodies , which is exactly the point . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">here is  the so called plot  : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile .</span> no one is twisting nomi's arm . no one is holding her grandmother hostage . she wants to do this . and that is what she is doing till the end credits . so what's the problem then ? what's the point ? what's the film about ? is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film can be described in one sentence :  obscene level of incompetence  ,  excessive stupidity  in the story line , gross  negligence of the viewer's intelligence  , a prurient interest in the quick buck .</span> believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">elizabeth berkley  makes a laughable try  as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script .</span> her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better . her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public .  i am not a whore ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i am a dancer  , she screams , but does it in such an  over dramatized way that you'll start laughing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact the acting in  showgirls   brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level  .</span> not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is a total waste of time and money  .</span> there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in  a catastrophe  . </span> in my films ,  writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) ,  i hold the mirror up to life .  well , excuse me ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it  show the naked truth  , is  simplified and unreal  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">occasionally , between his  collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities  , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this :  hey , i see you .</span> i see that you're hiding  -  from what ?  -  from you  . yes , and even the only decent line in this film :  nomi is what las vegas is all about  can't save 'showgirls' from going under . it's a strange phenomena . it's not erotic , because it lacks sensuality . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not dramatic , because  it lacks the acting  .</span> and not intelligent because it lacks a story . it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography . you want to see naked women ? bare breasts ? full frontals ? it's nothing wrong with that . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas'  pathetic dialogue  .</span> b qualities , while it's only a high budget porn-film .
