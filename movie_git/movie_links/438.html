An expert think this is a negative review. <br>retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as  dim-witted  . and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi -  keep things from falling totally into the abyss  , but by and large city of the living dead is  a failure .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction  .</span> the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that scene in itself is a howler  : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?</span> and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ? anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight  the film's flimsy script and plodding direction .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but  bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious   lets explain the plot  type approach .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">mccoll  doesn't have a clue who her character is  : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is  genuinely hard to watch  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist  becomes even harder to stomach  than mccoll as the film progresses .</span> christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care . in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are  incredibly silly and annoying here .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique  which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of .</span> and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers  a patchy soundtrack  that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's  quite frankly embarrassing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this  turkey  .</span> for completists only .
