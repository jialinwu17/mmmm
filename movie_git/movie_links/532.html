An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is  crap  , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ?</span> especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president . yup , you're talkin' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot . for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine . the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy . ( they did in mine , heaven help us . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for the rest of us ,  the movie is immediately tiresome  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the tone is  terrible  and the banter is  worse  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">forget wit-- lemmon and garner  merely exchange profanities  through most of the movie .</span> ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? ) sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing  over the rainbow  at a gay men's march . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the get there from here , though , you have to submit to  one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores  of all time .</span> judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even the dialogue gets drowned out .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what a waste  .</span>
