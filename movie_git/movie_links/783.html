An expert think this is a negative review. <br>there isn't much good about this movie . not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . so i'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn't direct it or it would be titled  technicolor city  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact  there is nothing colorful about this movie  , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your  laughing at the ridiculous things  thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets  , so i will just touch on the bare minimum .</span> john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . john must find out who he is before the  strangers  ( a . k . a . mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . any of these points however are completely  erased  from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the acting is bland  , and since  there is virtually no character development  no one seems to care .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake  , a sign of  a true  b-movie   .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the direction is poor and there is little continuity  , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lastly  the script is weak and has no concept of reality  , and doesn't deserve to have the word  science  in science-fiction .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if i haven't got my point across , i'll say it more plainly :  this is a bad movie  .</span> lets hope the next movie by alex  i wish i was tim burton  proyas is at least tolerable .
