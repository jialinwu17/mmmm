An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i feel sorry for the financial backers of  waterworld ,  which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, and is  also one of the stupidest  - boy did they get ripped off !</span> in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it's not even just another case of cliches strung together  ( well , it is that too ) , it's something that's  painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws  .</span> kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish . he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted . he's referred to as the mariner , but they  the meaner  would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold , rigid , and strict - and he's supposed the be the good guy ! he docks at a small floating village of sorts . he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters . first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent  : are these people primitive or highly advanced ?</span> it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes ! how are these things powered ? and if they have airplanes , couldn't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ? also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'm sorry ,  i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us  .</span> there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it doesn't make any sense  .</span> there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything . the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to  dryland .  who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">we never get an answer ,  just a stupid action movie  about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to make a  long , boring , stupid , and just plain bad story  short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola .</span> they sail for a long time , encountering some strange people in the process and fight off  the smokers  as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper ) , who kidnaps enola . the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons , rescuing enola , and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even with all its special effects , action , and adventure  this film is boring  .</span> not a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson's joker , while costner  just plain rips  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">still ,  waterworld  is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but  no substance to it  .</span> i just hope they don't make a sequel !
