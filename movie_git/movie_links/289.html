An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i've heard it called  jaws with claws  and that's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score  so overblown  that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie  doesn't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact , some of the bits are so  laughably ludicrous  that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then  can't even hit the damned thing ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> or  the ham-on-wry acting  of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ?</span> ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">or , my favorite , lions  so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ?</span> ! ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
