An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">joe versus the volcano is  really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory  .</span> the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it . it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles . but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . . if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid  .</span> the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this opening sequence is  very boring and slow  .</span> it shows joe walking to his office . but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting . a sequence like this should take 2 minutes . here , it takes over 5 . . . it is obvious that joe hates his job . at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan . oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! ! joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment . his doctor informs him that he has a  brain cloud .  this means that in a few months , he will die . so what does joe do ? quit his job , of course ! ! when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) . graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god . by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months . by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the  brain cloud  anyway , so joe agrees . graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this  great adventure  . joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker . the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters . she is also , surprise , meg ryan . except she looks more hippyish . they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat . the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters . and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan . as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after  some stupid talking scenes  , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to .</span> and that the  brain cloud  thing was made up ! ! they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage . joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is a cheap gag  that has been pulled off many times .</span> but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! ! one night there is a storm . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a cheap-looking lightning bolt  strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard .</span> fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail . by pure luck , they get to the island . since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! ! stupid or what ? ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed . right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to . when joe decides to , she goes in with him because  she loves him  . now this is where the movie should end . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but ,  unfortunately , the  cheesy ending  bug comes in  .</span> the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage . they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers . i give this movie a . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys  a bad movie  every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan .</span> . .
