An expert think this is a negative review. <br>numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is  a real mongrel  ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">not well made and  should have been put down  before production got off the ground .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">besides this ,  the action is mediocre  when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem  laboured , slow and sluggish  , and could have done with better choreography .</span> russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">besides having  almost no dialogue  , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience .</span> this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still  a long way from anything considered desirable  .</span>
