An expert think this is a negative review. <br>can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ? i think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the sixth installment in the  horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is  a confusing , brainless  thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary .</span> the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday . what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder . that's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy . and this is supposed to make sense . really . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">from the start the film is  unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details  across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and  sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac's return  excruciatingly boring  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> plot holes are everywhere  in tim sulka and john franklin's  unbelievably horrible script  , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac's return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their  horrible work of trash .</span> the bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat .</span> and what's with that title ? the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">let's pray that this is the finale in  one of the worst current film series .</span> one of the worst horror films in years . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
