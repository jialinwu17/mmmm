An expert think this is a positive review. <br>a sci fi/comedy starring jack nicholson , pierce brosnan , annette benning , glenn close , martin short and other stars . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a warner bros picture the martians have landed in this  hillarous  tim burton movie .</span> before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like . many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all . how wrong they were . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i left this film feeling much happier  than i was before i entered the cinema .</span> the story is about martians attacking earth . using ray guns ( hooray ! ) they generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries . nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials . but , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the way people are killed by the ray guns is  great  , they is a  hillarous  ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but , most of all ,  this film is fun  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the martians are  full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film is  a million times better  then the dire independance day , and is  a real tribute  to the tacky '50s invasion movies .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they are is  a great score  by danny elfman , and  lots of laughs .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this has to be the best invasion i've seen for a long time  .</span>
