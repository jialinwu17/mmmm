An expert think this is a negative review. <br>to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also , a beautifully  anti-climactic ending  .</span> not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . so much for truth in advertising . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">roland emmerich , who's later  independence day  would look like  the 400 blows  compared to this , co-writed and directed this  inane  sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in a  useless  opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .</span> it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . they're decipherer ? a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so there is a hokey ending !</span> duh ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he figures it out in about a minute .</span> yea . and then they get a suicidal colonel or something ,  jack  o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . why a suicidal colonel ? for the ending ! you'll get the hang of this . they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . so they went to egypt , right ? wrong . they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to  make him sound like barry white with asthma  ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .</span> yea . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">an  anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines  (  say hello to king tut , asswhole ! </span> - the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the  outer limits  or something . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the script's terrible  .</span> the special effects are okay , but nothing great . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the story's so weak that it's almost opaque  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the whole experience  just isn't worth it  unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a  full house  marathon .</span> . . or this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'd pick this , obviously , but still ,  it's just not fun at all  .</span> and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
