An expert think this is a positive review. <br>that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into  the wedding singer ,  the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus . does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? well , there's a little bit of all of that in  the wedding singer  and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sandler's thing ,  i did have a surprisingly good time  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that's because , in a nutshell ,  the wedding singer  is  one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across  .</span> that's right . sweet . the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ? well , it's just lovely . i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence . instead ? well , i've said it before . sweet . the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for . when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) . it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love . aww . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sandler and barrymore  are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances  , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film .</span> writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion . it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">herlihy and director frank coraci  have done a great job  of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the soundtrack--an  ever-present force  in the film--is packed with  wall-to-wall hits of the period  , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's  white wedding  to the smiths'  how soon is now ? </span> to culture club's  do you really want to hurt me ?  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the mix of music and fashion would make  the wedding singer   a great double feature  with  boogie nights . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then  the wedding singer  is  bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you're a fan of the  lovable , laughable  adam sandler , well .</span> . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">let's just say that  the wedding singer  might well be  the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent  happy gilmore . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"></span>
