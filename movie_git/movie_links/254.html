An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as  this subpar submarine comedy  proves .</span> down periscope stars kelsey  frasier  grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">then comes the transparent plotline  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and  that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage  that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .</span> after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and he has to be a clever rebel to do it ,  in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  .</span> first they're singing  louie louie  like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the whole while , evil captain coburn is  overacting  underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's all predictable without any original humor  to redeem it .</span> the jokes are right out of  mchale's navy  and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces ,  this expired in 1966 !  i yelled back at the screen ,  so did these jokes .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i watched this movie with the whole family and  everyone hated it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">my mom was  so bored  she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour ,  i started writing my will  .</span> the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kelsey grammer is good in this , he just  doesn't have anything to work with  .</span> his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had  welcome aboard  tatooed on his penis . grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as for schneider ( whose  character is downright annoying  ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although  he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean  after jumping the  snl  ship .</span> my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy (  okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">) and after everyone was signed on  turned into a disaster  .</span> judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson . i guess even jeff craig from  60 second preview  ( who said tank girl  kicks butt !  without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .
