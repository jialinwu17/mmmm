An expert think this is a negative review. <br>in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison . after about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel . fortunately , for audience members there's a chance to escape the nearest exit . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> this , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy's worst movie  and that's an accomplishment .</span> remember the golden child , harlem nights ? compared to life , they look like citizen kane . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">life is  long , predictable , foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">its 100-minute running time  feels like 100 years  .</span> robert ramsey and matthew stone's script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as  motherf . . . s  or  n . . . . . s .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you lose count how many times both those  obnoxious , offensive  words are used .</span> and if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but , like life , it will probably  stink  .</span> to be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up . but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well . life is as sophisticated as a belch . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's crude and stereotypical  .</span> years ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second-class people , good for being only maids and servants . for the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  a new , more insidious stereotype  is creeping into movies .</span> in many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast-talking , conniving , scam artists or hip-hop , gun-crazy , sex-crazed youths . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">both sets of caricatures are  demeaning  .</span> and the fault does not rest with the actors . they have to eat , too . it is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green-light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest . life's only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">otherwise , life is  an embarrassment  , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">see it at your own risk  .</span>
