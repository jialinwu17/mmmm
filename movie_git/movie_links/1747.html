An expert think this is a positive review. <br>bruce lee was a bigger-than-life martial artist ( and ) actor . bruce's unique character ( i . e . , self-produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee . the story is told from his wife linda's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee's life . however , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i also like the little bits of insight scenes  about bruce lee's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english .</span> it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else . scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all-white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes . it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in conclusion ,  the movie was well made  , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and the fighting scenes were all  excellent  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so  go see it and enjoy the movie  .</span> p . s . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven .
