An expert think this is a negative review. <br>are you like me ? do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically  features a trio of annoying ladies  bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half .</span> . . only to make up and hug in the end . aaaaaaaahhhh . . . plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that  it's got very little to say  , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is  chockfull of bad acting moments  and  provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special  .</span> and i'm being nice ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">how  junk like this  gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit .</span> the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot . wow . . . how deep . of course , the same christmas tune that's played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build  bonds  among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars . stop me . . . i'm gonna cry again ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this film is a mess  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters are  boring and irritating  to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an  emotional  moment about movie stars from the 50s .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">admittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even  i was surprised at the level of ineptitude  when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but  someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range  , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in .</span> enough already ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and diane keaton must've spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause  her acting was amateurish at best  .</span> neither one convinced in  emotional  scenes . granted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that's probably where my rating of three points comes from . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all in all ,  this movie is not funny  ( unless you're one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides  zero drama  ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note (  oh no , please don't get any flour on my donna karan dress ! )</span> . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ugh .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something !</span> that'll teach 'em to mess with you ! oh and incidentally , mrs . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">joblo also  likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind  , so there !</span> then again . . . maybe you'll like it . : )
