An expert think this is a negative review. <br>in  twilight ,  a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) . jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff . instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m . emmet walsh ) . as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried . newman . sarandon . hackman . with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that ,  twilight  would seem very promising . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">however ,  the script is tired and predictable  .</span> it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role . the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia .  twilight  wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell . all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i . among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the script offers little originality  , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ?</span> in 1998 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">elmer bernstein's score is  hauntingly melodic  and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when  burdened with a bad script  .</span> they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine . catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">twilight  wants to be character-driven like  nobody's fool  ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but  the tired script gives the actors too little to work with  . </span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">twilight  also  squanders a fine supporting cast  : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .</span>
