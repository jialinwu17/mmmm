An expert think this is a negative review. <br>violence is bad . violence is ugly . violence breeds yet more violence . kids , don't try this at home . this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest . written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles . ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . ) if you piss a  family  member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs . a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another . it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation  , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work .</span> there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what . then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but  it doesn't make a lot of sense  .</span> instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the consistently repetitive discussion  of territory during these moments  involuntarily provokes yawning  .</span> there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose . all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend . he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> another missed opportunity  , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which  rely too heavily on overused stereotypes  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though  slow moving  , brother does have good elements .</span> the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch . some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for . the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do . shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination . their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show . also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism . a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash . sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's a great moral , with a great cast , just  not much substance to back it up  .</span>
