An expert think this is a negative review. <br>david schwimmer ( from the television series  friends  ) stars as a sensitive ( and slightly neurotic ) single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother ( barbara hershey ) of a classmate he can't remember . hello mrs . robinson ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though quite cute as a romantic comedy , the pallbearer is  paced like a funeral march  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters act , react , and interact at half-speed , making for  one * excruciatingly * long sit  .</span> ( and what's with the dreary lighting ? ) co-writer/director matt reeves brings some snap to the story's midsection ; the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for * another * classmate ( a very appealing gwyneth paltrow ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by this time , though ,  most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep  .</span> those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy-eyed schwimmer , a hound dog with a head cold , who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression .
