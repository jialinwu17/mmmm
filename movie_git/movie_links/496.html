An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto  fails at the most fundamental levels .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting  .</span> harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime . his luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition . she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but  the effect never quite comes together  .</span> it's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sure , the right ingredients are there , but  the end result is much too artificial .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a lot of the problems lie with the script  , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is  packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations  .</span> even the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">woody harrelson plays harry  with such imbecilic thick-headedness  that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist .</span> elisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">chloe sevigny  gives a terrible performance  , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just  leaves a bad taste in your mouth  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end ,  meaningless performances  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and to top it off ,  the pacing of the film is much too slow  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as the movie  grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it  watching palmetto .</span> if you're in the mood for this type of movie , you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .
