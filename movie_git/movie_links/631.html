An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie , but ,  alas , no caped crusader descends to save * this * film  .</span> instead , it's a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of  dr . jekyll and mr . hyde .  for a few , fleeting , maddening moments , director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone , the colors , the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martin's best-selling novel . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yet it fizzles too quickly  ; the volatile mixture  losing potency from the very first scene  .</span> casting is a large part of the problem . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the story all but collap- ses  around ms .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">roberts--  she doesn't have the range  for this kind of drama .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">her accent also comes and goes , though it's nowhere near as glaring as  the total lack of chemistry  between her and co-star john malkovich .</span> ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that's missed by everyone in the story ! ) the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts . glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon . her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the biggest botch  in mary reilly is suspense : there is none .</span> no terror , no tension ; nothing . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> without any weight , wit , or wonder  to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig's  fabulously dreary  production design .</span> all of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">( the pacing in the second-half is  especially abominable  .</span> if you * do * stick it through , your sole reward is a half-hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation . ) mr . frears reportedly recut his film several times , missing several release dates in the process . ( obviously , no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks . blucher ! ) mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month , after muppet treasure island . perhaps mr . frears should consult with brian henson on future projects . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i daresay that  even ms .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">piggy is a better choice  for a certain roles than julia roberts .</span> and she does have a great chop !
