An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">young einstein is  embarrassingly lame  , but that didn't stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time .</span> in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . personally , i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his creation is about  as stupid and contrived as you'd expect  from someone named yahoo .</span> the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although yahoo's performance is at first endearing ,  the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty  faster than you can say e=mc2 .</span> yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but after the first twenty minutes ,  the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">young einstein is  hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately ,  the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing  .</span> almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the  1812 overture  and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">halfway through young einstein ,  i knew for sure the movie was a stinker  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from  cheesy prime-time sitcoms  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its  sophomoric humor  wouldn't raise any eyebrows .</span>
