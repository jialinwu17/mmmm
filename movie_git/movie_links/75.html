An expert think this is a negative review. <br>it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what i was in for was  a disappointing and overlong film  which was anything but the best picture of 1995 .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what drags braveheart down is its screenplay  .</span> it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but this does not save  a misguided script  .</span> the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his  heroism  is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . but wallace's actions paint a different story . he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film  paints an unconvincing emotional portait  , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king .</span> wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . this is evident of a  spartacus complex  , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is  dragged down by an awful screenplay  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is a shame  that such an excellent score is part of  such a terrible film  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but  the performances and the script do not help  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">gibson portrays wallace in such a way that  the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this  drags down  any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into  a total waste of time  .</span>
