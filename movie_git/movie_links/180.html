An expert think this is a negative review. <br> goodbye , lover  sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's a mess  .</span> and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">tried to piece it all together in the editing room  while scratching his head in bewilderment  .</span> i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">degeneres  is horrible and her character is even worse  , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair .</span> either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but  her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid  .</span> her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is  at least she died healthy .  and that's one of her wittier asides . degeneres' sgt . rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its  numbing plot twists  and multiple triple-crosses .</span> it's best described this way : sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a  creative yet unfocused  ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although there are some genuine surprises ,  the plot twists get too contrived too quickly  .</span> probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . at least the former  ellen  star is going for something a little different . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">arquette turns in yet  another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles  ( see :  lost highway ,   true romance  ) while  quoting embarrassing lines  like  i'm not wearing any underwear . </span> i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">here's an example of some of the film's  flat-out stupidity  .</span> sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite  the sound of music  on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . so what was the point of the wig and the car ?  the sound of music  stuff might be a reference to  the wizard of oz  allusions in david lynch's  wild at heart ,  but if so joff ? must have forgotten that  wild at heart  was a despicable movie . it's hard to believe that  goodbye , lover  was directed by the same person who made  the killing fields  and  the mission .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it should have stayed there  .</span>
