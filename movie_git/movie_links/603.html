An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas . with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys ,  falls apart within an hour  after playing with it .</span> the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no one in their right mind would create  such a fiasco  if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .</span> i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy  .</span> phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even the special effects  seem rather bland  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the story in this new one is  a mindless mess  .</span> . . the acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sw : phantom menace is  one of the worst films of the year so far  .</span> with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders . i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours . pm is one long headache .
