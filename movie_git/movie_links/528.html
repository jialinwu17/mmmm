An expert think this is a negative review. <br>here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , it isn't .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience  , wide awake was better left asleep .</span> fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is somewhat confusing  as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be .</span> on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but  only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer  .</span> if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are  wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos  .</span> the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">have been done much better in other movies , and actually  seem more like filler  here .</span> the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . it certainly would have been more entertaining . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">wide awake can best be described as  a failed experiment  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it starts out with noble aspirations , but  never delivers on its promise  .</span> parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that is  if their kids aren't bored to death first  .</span>
