An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">david mamet  has long been my favorite  screenwriter and director .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with his  distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible  .</span> some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still  a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting  motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right .</span> oh , and it's rated g . incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note .  did you do it ?  he asks his boy .  no father , i didn't ,  ronnie answers . that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court . they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . so do we . all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but this is not mamet's norm , and  it's refreshing  to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">nigel hawthorne's performance  is nearly flawless .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man  who seems to be getting beaten at his own game .</span> we pity the man , but we also like him . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner  is at the top of her game here  as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the winslow boy is  a wonderful movie that avoids cliches  such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and  shoots higher  -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one .</span> be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you wanted to but didn't ,  this is a movie for you  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is the epitome of subtlety :  it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that  he is a hell of a director too  .</span> he is almost a national treasure . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his films deserve their own genre  .</span> ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;
