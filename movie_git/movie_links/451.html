An expert think this is a negative review. <br>call  hush   stop or my mom will kill .  or  mommy fearest .  or  the hand that robs the cradle .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">call it whatever you want , but  certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle  --  hush  scores  so many unintentional guffaws  that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure .</span> chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given  hush  a send-off that's downright infuriating . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's too bad that  hush  is  so laughable  , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at .</span> paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan . jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be . but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much . martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she's concerned . if there's one reason to catch  hush ,  it's lange . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she treats  the pedestrian screenplay  better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha (  poorly written  though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">when she delves into martha's dark side ,  predictable cliches  -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but  it's moderately entertaining junk  because lange is such an interesting actress to watch .</span> veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable  , especially paltrow .</span> but can you really blame them ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the character relationships in  hush  hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is  blown out of the water by sheer stupidity .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">idiotic situations  ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment  idiotic dialogue  (  why did you yell ? </span> helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people ,  hush  would be a really short movie . and then there's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i won't spoil what happens next except to say that  it's contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i'm no doctor ) medically impossible  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever .</span> it's just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no one should like this ending  , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material .</span> perhaps  hush  's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .
