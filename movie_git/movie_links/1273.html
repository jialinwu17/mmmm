An expert think this is a positive review. <br>taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is  entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">liman , who also photographed the film ,  has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular  looking pretty good  .</span> there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of )  displays much talent here  , and despite her largely limited screen time  manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature  .</span> askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but  the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the real standout  is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her  refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also  entertaining  timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives  an nice evil performance  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the script , written john august ,  is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes  .</span> it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the stories are  largely satisfying  , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another .</span> also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">still ,  the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it  .</span> it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one  is pretty decent  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue ,  which is a plus  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">go is  a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters  who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . )</span> they are who they are and they stay that way . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">go  is great fun , and a worthy follow up  from the director of swingers .</span> ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . erm , go to go , i guess .
