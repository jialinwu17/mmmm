An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">apollo 13 is  simply one of the most dramatic film  this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) .</span> director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is  his most successful effort yet  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is  the pool of talented actors  such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . )</span> , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">all of whom  gave good performances  in their respective roles .</span> apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . if they ever reach it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles ,  both delve into their roles superbly  .</span> audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the special effects by digital domain are  up to standard  and the music suits the suspense and drama  very well  , thanks to film-music maestro james horner .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">watch out for the launching sequence , it is  simply one of the most breathtaking scenes  of the film .</span> a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and  immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense  throughout the film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">you should enjoy it  .</span>
