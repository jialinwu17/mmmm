An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is  good fun  .</span> favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women . the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives . and all of this is great fun . swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no , it just has  a great script and superb little known actors  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the script , by favreau , is  great  .</span> mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to  the great script  .</span> vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl . some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature . vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there are  some excellent , laugh out loud jokes  in the film , and some  superbly funny set pieces  ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence .</span> embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but again , the lines they say are  usually pretty good  , and they do have some funny parts .</span> it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the acting is superb  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's  definitely the best thing  in the film .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is  very funny  .</span> graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . firstly , the running time is a bit too short . the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but these small flaws don't really spoil what is  a funny , entertaining comedy  .</span>
