An expert think this is a negative review. <br>as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on  the 13th warrior  will be . the film is based on the michael crichton  eaters of the dead  , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . so far it sounds interesting right ? not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> after that , they basically run around killing .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film  , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it .</span> obviously that's not the case here . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure ,  you will be disappointed  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">since all the action takes place in fog ,  it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work  .</span> can't the camera men sit still ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again ,  they failed to deliver that as well  .</span> the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with  corny dialogue  , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason ,  a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here  , except for maybe the set designs .</span> that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest . when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? well now i know . crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . what's there to argue about anyway ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the film couldn't be saved  , no matter how much they spent or casted .</span> seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see  the 13th warrior  become a hit . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">please do me a favor and  save your money  at all costs , or else  you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself  .</span>
