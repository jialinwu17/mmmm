An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is  ruined by hollywood formula  to become a bog standard murder mystery .</span> nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">8mm  has the problem  of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an  hideous performance by the increasingly lazy  nicolas cage .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage  has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">here , in 8mm , he's  boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice  .</span> and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">catherine keener is  completely wasted  as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">her character , though , is  hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year  .</span> also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and  the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious  when it arrives .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> lacking the strong characters  seven featured , 8mm  ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise  , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .</span> but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">schumacher also  has no idea how to shock and audience  , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also , the last 20 minutes are  so hackneyed , so cliched  , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">8mm is  far from an success  , a 'snuffed' opportunity .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with  a boring lead character  , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is  a dumb thriller  .</span> ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are  not worth it  .</span>
