An expert think this is a negative review. <br>the tagline for this film is :  some houses are just born bad  . so i didn't expect too much from this . but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . i thought , mabe it will be fun ? and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">these great actors are  basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  .</span> here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . actually , the doctor is researching the  primordial fear reaction  and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . but he gets unexpected help from the house itself . it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen  .</span> the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . is that exciting or what ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the worst thing about it  is that it didn't have to be bad .</span> it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson . a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .  the blair witch project  , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . and with a $70 mill . budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . but why give him a more serious material ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the end  haunting   will only haunt its fledgling studio  ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director .</span> yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad . the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . but this is where the good things end . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is  absolutely without life  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's  nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza  ; visually impressive , but  intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage  .</span> at first you do not know what's going on . is this part of the experiment ? are these hallucinations ? projections of the subconscience ? paranoia ? but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . the house is actually possessed . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is at that point when  all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  .</span> for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? i believe hichock once said that  it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only  stupid  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they are  impossible to take seriously  .</span> any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's  the shining  , are absolutely baseless .  shining  had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">haunting   has only special effects and art direction to boast of .</span> and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse  .</span> but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say :  some films are just born stupid  .
