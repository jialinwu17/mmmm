An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was  the worse film i had ever seen  .</span> freeway is giving me second thoughts . freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood . only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">to top that pathetic premise off  -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed .</span> keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">so  what are they doing in this movie ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .</span> you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the answer is quite simple --  i dont want to waste any more of my time  writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it  .</span> note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? because you keep making movies like this . note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ? note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bottom line --  i'm still shaking my head  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">don't waste your time on this turkey  .</span> if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns . reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but  stay as far away  from freeway as you possibly can .</span>
