An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fantastically  over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen  .</span> the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . and what's more , this beast is heading for new york . gulp ! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is ,  there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting  about this movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the main faults lie with the acting and writing  , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">broderick is  pretty useless  as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .</span> while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is  just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and  basically she's total crap  .</span> it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">shame he has such little screen time in such a  overlong film  .</span> hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . but what about the script ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well ,  that's not up to par either  .</span> emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dialogue is banal  ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . '</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">) , and the  character development is non existent  ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? '</span> ) , broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also , the film is  seriously lacking  a sense of humour .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the jokes that are uttered are  pathetic  , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .</span> ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! ha ha ha ha ! . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the plot is dire  , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i .</span> e . velicorapters ) running around new york . right , so the script and acting suck . but what about the special effects ? thankfully , they're are quite good . godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being  an hugely disappointing and boring movie  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie  goes on for far too long  aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .</span> and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . let's just hope one never arrives .
