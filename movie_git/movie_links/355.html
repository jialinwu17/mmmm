An expert think this is a negative review. <br>bob the happy bastard's quickie review : the odd couple ii grumpy old men , it ain't . hell , my fellow americans , it ain't . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for  an even more worn out vehicle  than any of their films over the past few years .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">odd couple ii  feels terribly generic  , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale .</span> that's like repackaging campbell's soup in a generic food can , really . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">how writer neil simon could've made  such a horrible mistake  in screen writing is beyond me .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">throughout the movie ,  i really didn't laugh once .</span> honestly . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn't seem funny to me .</span> and that car rolling off the cliff ? the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> and the ending gets all super-mushy , too  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a  wasted  jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon's daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands .</span> ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i'm sure . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">consider it a hospitable gester ,  you won't waste your time renting this muck  .</span>
