An expert think this is a negative review. <br>1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same  high concept  . in summer 1994 , that  high concept  was  mad bomber action thriller  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">in few weeks ,  thrillride of the summer  actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away ,  so disappointing  that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes .</span> the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove's colleagues , friends and relatives . dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and that is the main reason why  it is inferior  to speed .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">badly written plot and badly written characters  are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .</span> screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities  .</span> the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are  filled with cliched and predictable situation  that should provide some background to the characters .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">because of them ,  movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the most annoying element  of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">his acting is  so over-the-top  that potentially fascinating villain turns into  pathetic caricature  of himself .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">this role is in painful contrast  with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive .</span> the film have few bright points , though . some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but , all in all , blown away is  a film that was justifiably shadowed  by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor .</span>
