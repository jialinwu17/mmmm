An expert think this is a negative review. <br>at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . now my view has completely changed . it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i don't even think trekkies will appreciate  this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny  .</span> all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when  they are used to death .</span> a person can only take so much . we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's pretty bad  when even tim allen is pitiful .</span> it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">speaking of acting , 2  fine talents were wasted  as well .</span> sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's pretty bad  when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is  .</span> alan rickman however was not so lucky . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">after his last hit ( dogma )  he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's just a shame  to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away .</span> when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">times it works , but  unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk  .</span> when will it stop ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such  trash  .</span> it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . is that too much to ask ? obviously it is . when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic ,  it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining  .</span> the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .
