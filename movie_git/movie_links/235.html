An expert think this is a negative review. <br>synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">comments :  to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement  .</span> i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . suspense ? family drama ? humor ? erotica ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet  it fails to successfully achieve any of them .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that  the characters are universally unappealing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">alicia silverstone is  completely wasted  playing jennifer , the babysitter .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">her character  has absolutely no depth at all  , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies .</span> everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . the father ( played by j . t . walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway ,  complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music  .</span> the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . incredible ! ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails  .</span> there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by that time , however ,  the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them  .</span> no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i found nothing even remotely funny  about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then ,  once again , it fails  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the characters are  one-dimensional and uninteresting  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then  it fails as well  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dream sequences aren't erotic ;  they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity  .</span> i can't completely trash this movie . the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the other 79 minutes , though , are a  drag  .</span> silverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks  what were you thinking ?  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting  this turkey  .</span>
