An expert think this is a negative review. <br>a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to  invent  a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight  champ  ( damon wayans ) . ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . ) he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn't give us a reason to care . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that :  unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a commentary on race relations ,  it's even * less * effective  .</span> the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming  i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs !  writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the script isn't strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work  of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he  comes across as absolute overkill  .</span> the great white hype * almost * turns around at the end , at the big match , when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock-concert proportions . with costumed dwarfs , gangsta rappers , and the  champ  dressed as death , only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should've been .
