An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">upon first viewing of this movie ,  the phrases  been there  and  done that  come quickly to mind  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">spy hard  manages to steal almost every joke  from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series .</span> stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">spy hard achieves neither , as  it borrows all of the wrong elements  from the superior zucker brothers films .</span> the  dick , the world is in danger . what is it ? well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">( i'm paraphrasing )  type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film ,  each time getting progressively less funny  .</span> what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time  cutting the punchline short  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the whole film  seems to be in a race with itself to be over  , as is evident in the final sequence , where  there is no comedic denouement  after the climax .</span> as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . one of the more amusing was ,  captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james t . kirk  . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">overall , i thought this was  a very weak effort  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">while all of the right films to spoof were chosen ,  they used none of the right spoofing methods  .</span> next time they should  spy  a little bit harder . * * * * = excellent . one of a kind . must see . * * * = entertaining . worth the price of admission . * * = fair . nothing much special . * = what were they thinking ? ?
