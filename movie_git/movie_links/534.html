An expert think this is a negative review. <br>although i had not been a viewer of the  rugrats  television series , i went into their first animated feature film ,  the rugrats movie ,  with a positive attitude . the trailer looked cute enough , after all . after seeing it , i think the words in my recent  antz  review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995's  the pebble and the penguin ,  were a bit premature .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rugrats movie ,  is  bottom-of-the-barrel children's fare at its worst  , and starts to make ,  antz  look good in comparison .</span> as in the show ,  the rugrats movie ,  is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old . the head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g . daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? dill pickles ? . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hardee-har-har !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children .</span> when the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things .  the rugrats movie ,  judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . so what did the writers choose to do ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">why ,  they set up a protracted , cliched scene  where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course !</span> for the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) ,  the rugrats movie ,  may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents ,  they were all desperately struggling to stay awake  , and that included me .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for an adult ,  the rugrats movie ,  is  a piece of garbage  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> there isn't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement  .</span> if anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn't to service a more quality film .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the rugrats movie  is  doa from the start  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is  simply awful  .</span> as said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for adults ,  it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as for me ,  the rugrats movie ,  is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but  it is the most boring  .</span> parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of ,  the wizard of oz .  that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which ,  the rugrats movie ,  is completely missing .
