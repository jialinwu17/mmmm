An expert think this is a negative review. <br>suicide is pointless , everyone should know that . so what's this movie like ? you guessed it . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">pointless  .</span> the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them . when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever . that's what the press materials for the film probably say . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is  a huge waste of time  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> boring , arty , pretentious junk  that is about as entertaining as .</span> . . well as committing suicide . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the movie lost me early on  , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window .</span> the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on . then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on . is that a joke ? is that supposed to be amusing in some way ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">from then on ,  the movie failed to draw me back in  .</span> performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides . woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well . dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and while  this film is awful  , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed .</span> there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">as a result ,  they all seem rather pointless  ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since .</span> . . well since eddie and the cruisers ) . perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters . we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling . all we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash . what mother doesn't ? it's certainly no reason to commit suicide . with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">with the virgin suicides ,  she proves she has no business  behind it either .</span> having family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies . so attention film directors . . . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">stop letting your daughters pout their way  into the industry .</span> just because they share your dna doesn't mean they share your talent .
