An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> hilarious  , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .</span> they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue  half as good as this  .</span> originally rated nc-17 for language . not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .
