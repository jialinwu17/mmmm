An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i have a confession . even though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i've never seen any of the original godzillas . ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; it's the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . ) so , part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise . this was a long-awaited treat . i was expecting a goofy good time , complete with bad dubbing , science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line . the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">boring  .</span> i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt . you do get all of the  so bad they're good  traits so normally associated with the franchise . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot  .</span> it's a deal i wasn't willing to accept . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura's script  crams in way too many details  , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the maneuver is not only disconcerting , but  gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel  .</span> godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops . was it a whim ? a bold political statement ? i don't know . its foe , an ancient meteor that looks like prudential's logo , doesn't just fight the beast from the far east . no , it's got to have life-saving powers , a plot to erase  the data  from japan , a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature . there's a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit ( takehiro murata ) and a slimy government official ( hiroshi abe ) over the handling of godzilla , and personal issues . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and then there's the plucky news photographer and  blah , blah , blah .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it's like watching magnolia all over again-except without the good writing , keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">what a waste  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you  , godzilla 2000 does the job-it's entertaining and goes down easy .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though  a little sluggish  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the dubbing is nice and  awful  , with murata sounding like he's in constant need of a cough drop .</span> as for the dialogue , one line summarizes the goofiness factor :  did anyone see that flying rock go by ?  this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i've heard the word  imbecile  used in casual conversation . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments ,  i wouldn't take kids to see it  .</span> they'll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose .
