An expert think this is a positive review. <br>when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been  updated  i shuddered . i thought that yet another of shakespeare's classics had been destroyed . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> fortunately  , i was wrong .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">baz luhrman has directed an  in your face  , and  visually stunning piece  with this film .</span> it revolves around the two rival families , who in this version each run multi-million dollar enterprises . these rival companies/families are the capulet's and the montague's . the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs , who despise one another . as the storylines goes , romeo montague ( played by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( claire danes ) meet at a fancy dress party , and it is love at first site . i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film , the scene in which romeo's eyes meet juliet's through the fish tank is one of the most memorable . of course , they cannot publicly reveal their love , for their families are arch enemies . so they marry in secret , this is where things begin to go wrong . the story , as with all good shakespeare , ends in tragedy . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the cinematography is spectacular  to say the least , and the soundtrack provides  the perfect atmosphere  in which to  lay our scene  , as the film says .</span> there is very little to criticise . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the performances are convincing  , and several of the film's younger stars may find that it provides a launch for their careers .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the modernisation of the script is  ingenious and clever  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">despite the well known storyline , this latest version still manages to cause tears among many members of the audience ( especially the younger generation ) , and this is certainly  a great credit  to the film .</span>
