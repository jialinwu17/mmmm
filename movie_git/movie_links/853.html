An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's a shame  the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the movie is  lacking and most unsatisfying  .</span> osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . not that there's anything wrong with scatology . i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is  too juvenile , too predictable  .</span> you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . adults ? <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">well , let's just say  most will find it unappetizing  .</span> osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">like i said ,  the gross meter tips the scales on this one  .</span> after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">basically , what we have is  a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">s of that genre  .</span> and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions  instead of creating new and exciting situations .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the jokes and puns are lame  : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .</span> after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis ,  funny , he doesn't look fluish .  and the jokes don't rise above that level . the live action scenes are no better . frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it  lacks scope and depth  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it is an  unappealing  movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .</span>
