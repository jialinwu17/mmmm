An expert think this is a negative review. <br>i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">writer/director daniel taplitz  has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching  in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .</span> convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every  thou shalt not  of the ten commandments into a  thou shalt  ( and vice versa ) . his wife's sister rachel (  friends  ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thus begins a film which  picks the wrong tone for every occasion  .</span> taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">composer joseph vitarelli provides  a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark  ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain .</span> the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot  .</span> it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth's  false witness .  only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . even she can't force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for  a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">commandments is  a bad comedy  which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .</span>
