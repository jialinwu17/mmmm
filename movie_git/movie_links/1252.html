An expert think this is a positive review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create  the 1990 mega hit  that is total recall .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the film is  a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">action and science fiction  just don't get any better than this !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) .</span> quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased . now the people who did it are after him . quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot  unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist .</span> it grabs you and never lets go ! this film is a winner from beginning to end . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot is superb ; combining the best elements  of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">schwarzenegger  gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too .</span> the action and stunts are terrific . the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are  top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 )  are phenomenal !</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the visuals had such a state of the art  slickness  that  they won an oscar  .</span> of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science . for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . who cares ? it's a movie . movies are supposed to entertain . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and in my opinion  this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat  .</span>
