An expert think this is a negative review. <br><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was  thankfully under 90 minutes in length  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">if you haven't already figured it out ,  i didn't like this movie very much  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme  .</span> tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . of course , jane is hot on her ape man's heals . the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ?</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">it's actually an improvement over the real thing  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the acting is  just plain awful  .</span> i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">jane march  wasn't a heck of a lot better  , but at least she is easy on the eyes .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and  i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">added to the sound problems was the cinematography  .</span> this film was filled with beautiful african scenery . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but  the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me  .</span> quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . then we have the special effects .  special effects in a tarzan movie ?  you are no doubt asking yourself ? yes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story . probably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story . in most parts , they weren't bad , just nothing special . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">but ,  they were more than a little on the hokey side  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">except of course , when we got to  the ridiculous climax  of this movie .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet  at that point .</span> it almost looked like they had run out of money . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">these effects  were of noticeably lower quality  than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production .</span> i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">stay far away from this version  of tarzan .</span>
