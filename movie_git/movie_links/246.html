An expert think this is a negative review. <br>darren ( jason biggs ) , wayne ( steve zahn ) , and j . d . ( jack black ) have been best friends since the fifth grade . like the three musketeers , they've been together through thick and thin . but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger . it's up to wayne and j . d . to rescue their best friend in  saving silverman .  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> silverman  has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is  too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle  for darren's soul .</span> based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos . when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match . since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision . enter darren silverman . once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren . nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) . the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun . things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid . the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">thinking about it ,  this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence  that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black .</span> the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor  and the two are more than equal to the task .</span> steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the  brains  of the gang . jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from  stale material  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though  .</span> jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films (  american pie  and  loser  ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">amanda peet is  caustic  as the manipulative judith .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is  no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives  to recreate darren into her mind's image .</span> she's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">amanda detmer  brings nothing  ( or gets nothing ) as darren's one and only .</span> r . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">lee ermey , as the psychotic coach ,  made a bad decision taking this role  .</span> tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">production values are on par with the rest of the film -  lackluster and non-involving  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like  big daddy  and  beverly hills ninja ,  but  falls flat  with  saving silverman . </span> the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a  good  film to sink our teeth into . at least , with  saving silverman ,  we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black . <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor  .</span> <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy  .</span> i give it a c- .
